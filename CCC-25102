The following transactions are exempted from the provisions of
Section 25110:

...

(o) An offer or sale of any security issued by a corporation or limited
    liability company pursuant to a purchase plan or agreement, or
    issued pursuant to an option plan or agreement, where the security
    at the time of issuance or grant is exempt from registration
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Rule 701
    adopted pursuant to that act (17 C.F.R. 230.701), the provisions
    of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this section,
    provided that

    (1) the terms of any purchase plan or agreement shall comply with
        Sections 260.140.42, 260.140.45, and 260.140.46 of Title 10
        of the California Code of Regulations,

    (2) the terms of any option plan or agreement shall comply with
        Sections 260.140.41, 260.140.45, and 260.140.46 of Title 10
        of the California Code of Regulations, and

    (3) the issuer files a notice of transaction in accordance with
        rules adopted by the commissioner no later than 30 days
        after the initial issuance of any security under that plan,
        accompanied by a filing fee as prescribed by subdivision (y)
        of Section 25608.

    The failure to file the notice of transaction within the time
    specified in this subdivision shall not affect the availability
    of this exemption. An issuer that fails to file the notice shall,
    within 15 business days after discovery of the failure to file
    the notice or after demand by the commissioner, whichever occurs
    first, file the notice and pay the commissioner a fee equal to the
    maximum aggregate fee payable had the transaction been qualified
    under Section 25110.

    Offers and sales exempt pursuant to this subdivision shall be deemed
    to be part of a single, discrete offering and are not subject to
    integration with any other offering or sale, whether qualified under
    Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 25110), or otherwise exempt,
    or not subject to qualification.
