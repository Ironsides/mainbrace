10 CCR § 260.140.45. Limitation on Number of Securities.

(a) The total number of securities issuable upon exercise of all
    outstanding options [exclusive of rights described in Section
    260.140.40 and warrants described in Sections 260.140.43 and
    260.140.44 of these rules, and any purchase plan or agreement as
    described in Section 260.140.42 of these rules (provided that the
    purchase plan or agreement provides that all securities will have
    a purchase price of 100% of the fair value (Section 260.140.50)
    of the security either at the time the person is granted the
    right to purchase securities under the plan or agreement or at
    the time the purchase is consummated)], and the total number of
    securities called for under any bonus or similar plan or agreement
    shall not exceed a number of securities which is equal to 30%
    of the then outstanding securities of the issuer (convertible
    preferred or convertible senior common shares of stock will be
    counted on an as if converted basis), exclusive of securities
    subject to promotional waivers under Section 260.141, unless a
    percentage higher than 30% is approved by at least two-thirds of
    the outstanding securities entitled to vote.

(b) The 30% limitation set forth in this Rule, or such other
    percentage limitation as may be approved pursuant to this Rule,
    shall be deemed satisfied if the plan or agreement provides that
    at no time shall the total number of securities issuable upon
    exercise of all outstanding options and the total number of shares
    provided for under any stock bonus or similar plan or agreement
    of the issuer exceed the applicable percentage as calculated
    in accordance with the conditions and exclusions of this Rule,
    based on the securities of the issuer which are outstanding at
    the time the calculation is made.

(c) This section shall not apply to any plan or agreement that
    complies with all conditions of Rule 701 of the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended (17 C.F.R. 230.701); provided that for purposes
    of determining such compliance, any registered domestic partner
    shall be considered a “family member” as that term is defined
    in Rule 701.
