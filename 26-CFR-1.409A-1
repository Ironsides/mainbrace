26 C.F.R. 1.409A-1

Definitions and covered plans.

(a) Nonqualified deferred compensation plan---

    (1) In general.

        Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a), the
        term nonqualified deferred compensation plan means any plan
        (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) that
        provides for the deferral of compensation (within the meaning
        of paragraph (b) of this section). Whether a plan provides
        for the deferral of compensation generally is determined at
        the time the service provider obtains a legally binding right
        to the compensation under the plan, and is not affected by any
        retroactive change to the plan to characterize the right as one
        that does not provide for the deferral of compensation. For
        example, amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred
        compensation plan do not become an excluded death benefit if
        the plan is amended so that the amounts are payable only upon
        the death of the service provider. If a principal purpose of
        a plan is to achieve a result with respect to a deferral of
        compensation that is inconsistent with the purposes of section
        409A, the Commissioner may treat the plan as a nonqualified
        deferred compensation plan for purposes of section 409A and
        the regulations thereunder.

    (2) Qualified employer plans.

        The term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not
        include a qualified employer plan. The term qualified employer
        plan means any of the following plans:

        (i) Any plan described in section 401(a) and a trust exempt
            from tax under section 501(a) or that is described in
            section 402(d).

        (ii) Any annuity plan described in section 403(a).

        (iii) Any annuity contract described in section 403(b).

        (iv) Any simplified employee pension (within the meaning of
            section 408(k)).

        (v) Any simple retirement account (within the meaning of
            section 408(p)).

        (vi) Any plan under which an active participant makes
            deductible contributions to a trust described in section
            501(c)(18).

        (vii) Any eligible deferred compensation plan (within the
            meaning of section 457(b)).

        (viii) Any plan described in section 415(m).

        (ix) Any plan described in section 1022(i)(2) of the Employee
            Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, Public Law 93-406
            (88 Stat. 829, 942) (Sept. 2, 1974) (ERISA).

    (3) Certain foreign plans---

        (i) Participation addressed by treaty.

            With respect to an individual for a taxable year, the term
            nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not include
            any scheme, trust, arrangement, or plan maintained with
            respect to such individual, to the extent contributions
            made by or on behalf of such individual to such scheme,
            trust, arrangement, or plan, or credited allocations,
            accrued benefits, earnings, or other amounts constituting
            income, of such individual under such scheme, trust,
            arrangement, or plan, are excludable by such individual
            for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to any bilateral
            income tax convention, or other bilateral or multilateral
            agreement, to which the United States is a party.

        (ii) Participation by nonresident aliens, certain resident
            aliens, and bona fide residents of possessions.

            With respect to an alien individual for a taxable
            year during which such individual is a nonresident
            alien, a resident alien classified as a resident
            alien solely under section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) (and not
            section 7701(b)(1)(A)(i)), or a bona fide resident of a
            possession (within the meaning of section 937(a)), the
            term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not
            include any broad-based foreign retirement plan (within
            the meaning of paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section).

        (iii) Participation by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent
            residents.

            With respect to an individual for a given taxable year
            during which such individual is a U.S. citizen or a
            resident alien classified as a resident alien under
            section 7701(b)(1)(A)(i), other than an individual who
            is also a bona fide resident of a possession (within
            the meaning of section 937(a)), the term nonqualified
            deferred compensation plan does not include a broad-based
            foreign retirement plan (within the meaning of paragraph
            (a)(3)(v) of this section), but only with respect to
            a plan, or a portion of a plan where such portion may
            be distinguished, providing for nonelective deferrals
            of modified foreign earned income, and earnings with
            respect to such nonelective deferrals, and only to the
            extent that the amounts deferred under all such plans of
            the service recipient, or all portions of such plans, in
            which the service provider participates in such taxable
            year, do not exceed the applicable limits under section
            415(b) (applied to nonaccount balance plans as defined in
            paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section) and section 415(c)
            (applied to account balance plans as defined in paragraph
            (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section) that would be applicable
            if such plans were plans subject to section 415 and the
            modified foreign earned income of such individual were
            treated as compensation for purposes of applying section
            415(b) and (c). For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(iii),
            the term modified foreign earned income means foreign
            earned income as defined in section 911(b)(1) without
            regard to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without regard
            to the requirement that the income be attributable to
            services performed during the period described in section
            911(d)(1)(A) or (B). The provisions of this paragraph
            (a)(3)(iii) do not apply to any individual with respect to
            any taxable year in which the individual is simultaneously
            eligible to participate in a broad-based foreign retirement
            plan and a qualified employer plan described in paragraph
            (a)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph
            (a)(3)(iii), an individual is eligible to participate in a
            qualified employer plan if under the terms of the plan and
            without further amendment or action by the plan sponsor,
            the individual is eligible to make or receive contributions
            or accrue benefits under the plan (regardless of whether
            the individual has elected to participate in the plan).

        (iv) Plans subject to a totalization agreement and similar
            plans.

            The term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not
            include any social security system of a jurisdiction to
            the extent that benefits provided under or contributions
            made to the system are subject to an agreement entered
            into pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security
            Act (42 U.S.C. 433) with any foreign jurisdiction. In
            addition, the term nonqualified deferred compensation plan
            does not include a social security system of a foreign
            jurisdiction to the extent that benefits are provided under
            or contributions are made to a government-mandated plan as
            part of that foreign jurisdiction's social security system.

        (v) Broad-based foreign retirement plan.

            The term broad-based foreign retirement plan means a
            scheme, trust, arrangement, or plan (regardless of whether
            sponsored by a U.S. person) that is written and that,
            in the case of an employer-maintained plan, satisfies
            the following conditions:

            (A) The plan is nondiscriminatory insofar as the employees
                who, under the terms of the plan (alone or in
                combination with other comparable plans) and without
                further amendment or action by the employer, are
                eligible to make or receive contributions or accrue
                benefits under the plan other than earnings (regardless
                of whether the employee has elected to participate in
                the plan), are a wide range of employees, substantially
                all of whom are nonresident aliens, resident aliens
                classified as resident aliens solely under section
                7701(b)(1)(A)(ii) (and not section 7701(b)(1)(A)(i)),
                or bona fide residents of a possession (within the
                meaning of section 937(a)), including rank and file
                employees.

            (B) The plan (alone or in combination with other comparable
                plans) actually provides significant benefits for a
                substantial majority of such covered employees.

            (C) The benefits actually provided under the plan to such
                covered employees are nondiscriminatory.

            (D) The plan contains provisions or is the subject of
                tax law provisions or other legal restrictions
                that generally discourage employees from using
                plan benefits for purposes other than retirement or
                restrict access to plan benefits before separation from
                service, including (but not limited to), restricting
                in-service distributions except in events similar
                to an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in section
                1.409A-3(i)(3)(i)) or hardship (as defined for purposes
                of section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV)), or for educational
                purposes or the purchase of a primary residence.

    (4) Section 457 plans.

        A nonqualified deferred compensation plan under section 457(f)
        may constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
        for purposes of this paragraph (a). The rules of section
        409A apply to nonqualified deferred compensation plans
        separately and in addition to any requirements applicable
        to such plans under section 457(f). In addition, nonelective
        deferred compensation of non-employees described in section
        457(e)(12) and a grandfathered plan or arrangement described in
        section 1.457-2(k)(4) may constitute a nonqualified deferred
        compensation plan for purposes of this paragraph (a). The
        term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not include
        a length of service award to a bona fide volunteer under
        section 457(e)(11)(A)(ii). For purposes of the application
        of section 409A to a plan to which section 457 applies,
        a payment under the plan generally means the provision of
        cash or property to the service provider, provided that for
        purposes of the application of the short-term deferral rule
        set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the inclusion
        in income of an amount under section 457(f) is treated as a
        payment of the amount.

    (5) Certain welfare benefits.

        The term nonqualified deferred compensation plan does not
        include a plan, or a portion of a plan, to the extent that
        the plan provides bona fide vacation leave, sick leave,
        compensatory time, disability pay, or death benefits. For
        these purposes, the terms "disability pay" and "death
        benefits" have the same meanings as provided in section
        31.3121(v)(2)-1(b)(4)(iv)(C) of this chapter, provided that
        for purposes of this paragraph, such disability pay and
        death benefits may be provided through insurance and the
        lifetime benefits payable under the plan are not treated
        as including the value of any taxable term life insurance
        coverage or taxable disability insurance coverage provided
        under the plan. The term nonqualified deferred compensation
        plan also does not include any Archer Medical Savings Account
        as described in section 220, any Health Savings Account as
        described in section 223, or any other medical reimbursement
        arrangement, including a health reimbursement arrangement,
        that satisfies the requirements of section 105 and section
        106 such that the benefits or reimbursements provided under
        such arrangement are not includible in income.

(b) Deferral of compensation---

    (1) In general.

        Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) through
        (b)(12) of this section, a plan provides for the deferral of
        compensation if, under the terms of the plan and the relevant
        facts and circumstances, the service provider has a legally
        binding right during a taxable year to compensation that,
        pursuant to the terms of the plan, is or may be payable to
        (or on behalf of) the service provider in a later taxable
        year. Such compensation is deferred compensation for purposes
        of section 409A, this section and sections 1.409A-2 through
        1.409A-6. A legally binding right to an amount that will be
        excluded from income when and if received does not constitute
        a deferral of compensation, unless the service provider
        has received the right in exchange for, or has the right to
        exchange the right for, an amount that will be includible in
        income (other than due to participation in a cafeteria plan
        described in section 125). A service provider does not have
        a legally binding right to compensation to the extent that
        compensation may be reduced unilaterally or eliminated by the
        service recipient or other person after the services creating
        the right to the compensation have been performed. However,
        if the facts and circumstances indicate that the discretion
        to reduce or eliminate the compensation is available or
        exercisable only upon a condition, or the discretion to reduce
        or eliminate the compensation lacks substantive significance,
        a service provider will be considered to have a legally binding
        right to the compensation. Whether the discretion to reduce
        or eliminate the compensation lacks substantive significance
        depends on all the relevant facts and circumstances. However,
        where the service provider to whom the compensation may be paid
        has effective control of the person retaining the discretion to
        reduce or eliminate the compensation, or has effective control
        over any portion of the compensation of the person retaining
        the discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation, or
        is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)
        applied as if the family of an individual includes the
        spouse of any member of the family) of the person retaining
        the discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation, the
        discretion to reduce or eliminate the compensation will not be
        treated as having substantive significance. For this purpose,
        compensation is not considered subject to unilateral reduction
        or elimination merely because it may be reduced or eliminated
        by operation of the objective terms of the plan, such as the
        application of a nondiscretionary, objective provision creating
        a substantial risk of forfeiture. Similarly, a service provider
        does not fail to have a legally binding right to compensation
        merely because the amount of compensation is determined
        under a formula that provides for benefits to be offset by
        benefits provided under another plan (including a plan that
        is qualified under section 401(a)), or because benefits are
        reduced due to actual or notional investment losses, or, in
        a final average pay plan, subsequent decreases in compensation.

    (2) Earnings.

        References to the deferral of compensation or deferred
        compensation include references to earnings. When the right
        to earnings is specified under the terms of the plan, the
        legally binding right to earnings arises at the time of the
        deferral of the compensation to which the earnings relate. A
        plan may provide that the time and form of payment of earnings
        is treated separately from the time and form of payment of
        the underlying compensation, so that, provided that the rules
        of section 409A are otherwise met, a plan may provide that
        earnings will be paid at a separate time or in a separate
        form from the payment of the underlying compensation. For the
        application of the deferral election rules to current payments
        of earnings and dividend equivalents, see section 1.409A-3(e).

    (3) Compensation payable pursuant to the service recipient's
        customary payment timing arrangement.

        A deferral of compensation does not occur solely because
        compensation is paid after the last day of the service
        provider's taxable year pursuant to the timing arrangement
        under which the service recipient normally compensates
        service providers for services performed during a payroll
        period described in section 3401(b), or with respect to a
        non-employee service provider, a period not longer than the
        payroll period described in section 3401(b) or if no such
        payroll period exists, a period not longer than the earlier of
        the normal timing arrangement under which the service provider
        normally compensates non-employee service providers or 30
        days after the end of the service provider's taxable year.

    (4) Short-term deferrals---

        (i) In general.

            A deferral of compensation does not occur under a plan
            with respect to any payment (as defined in section
            1.409A-2(b)(2)) that is not a deferred payment, provided
            that the service provider actually or constructively
            receives such payment on or before the last day of the
            applicable 2 1/2 month period. The following rules apply
            for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i):

            (A) The applicable 2 1/2 month period is the period ending
                on the later of the 15th day of the third month
                following the end of the service provider's first
                taxable year in which the right to the payment is no
                longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or
                the 15th day of the third month following the end of
                the service recipient's first taxable year in which
                the right to the payment is no longer subject to a
                substantial risk of forfeiture.

            (B) A payment is treated as actually or constructively
                received if the payment is includible in income,
                including if the payment is includible in income
                under section 83, the economic benefit doctrine,
                section 402(b), or section 457(f).

            (C) A right to a payment that is never subject to a
                substantial risk of forfeiture is considered to be
                no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
                on the first date the service provider has a legally
                binding right to the payment.

            (D) A payment is a deferred payment if it is made pursuant
                to a provision of a plan that provides for the payment
                to be made or completed on or after any date, or upon
                or after the occurrence of any event, that will or
                may occur later than the end of the applicable 2 1/2
                month period, such as a separation from service, death,
                disability, change in control event, specified time
                or schedule of payment, or unforeseeable emergency,
                regardless of whether an amount is actually paid as
                a result of the occurrence of such a payment date or
                event during the applicable 2 1/2 month period. If a
                plan provides that the service provider or service
                recipient may make an election under the plan
                (including an election under section 1.409A-2(a)(4))
                of a different payment date, schedule, or event,
                such right is disregarded for this purpose. In such
                cases, whether a plan provides for a deferred payment
                is determined based on the payment date, schedule,
                or event that would apply if no such election were
                made, except that if the plan would not provide for
                a deferred payment absent such an election, and the
                service provider or service recipient makes such an
                election, whether the plan provides for a deferred
                payment is determined based upon the payment date,
                schedule, or event that the service provider or
                service recipient in fact elected.

            (E) A stock right provides for a deferred payment if such
                right includes any provision pursuant to which the
                holder of the stock right will or may have the right
                to exercise the stock right after the applicable 2
                1/2 month period.

            (F) This paragraph (b)(4)(i) is applied separately to
                each payment (as defined in section 1.409A-2(b)(2))
                required to be made under a plan.

            (G) If a plan provides for a deferred payment with
                respect to part of a payment (for example a life
                annuity or a series of installment amounts treated as
                a single payment), the plan provides for a deferred
                payment with respect to the entire payment.

        (ii) Certain delayed payments.

            A payment that otherwise qualifies as a short-term deferral
            under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section but is made
            after the applicable 2 1/2 month period may continue
            to qualify as a short-term deferral if the taxpayer
            establishes that it was administratively impracticable to
            make the payment by the end of the applicable 2 1/2 month
            period and, as of the date upon which the legally binding
            right to the compensation arose, such impracticability was
            unforeseeable, or the taxpayer establishes that making the
            payment by the end of the applicable 2 1/2 month period
            would have jeopardized the ability of the service recipient
            to continue as a going concern, and provided further
            that the payment is made as soon as administratively
            practicable or as soon as the payment would no longer have
            such effect. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii),
            an action or failure to act of the service provider or
            a person under the service provider's control, such as a
            failure to provide necessary information or documentation,
            is not an unforeseeable event. In addition, a payment
            that otherwise qualifies as a short-term deferral under
            paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section but is made after the
            applicable 2 1/2 month period may continue to qualify
            as a short-term deferral if the taxpayer establishes
            that the service recipient reasonably anticipated that
            the service recipient's deduction with respect to such
            payment otherwise would not be permitted by application of
            section 162(m), and, as of the date the legally binding
            right to the payment arose, a reasonable person would
            not have anticipated the application of section 162(m)
            at the time of the payment, and provided further that
            the payment is made as soon as reasonably practicable
            following the first date on which the service recipient
            anticipates or reasonably should anticipate that, if the
            payment were made on such date, the service recipient's
            deduction with respect to such payment would no longer be
            restricted due to the application of section 162(m). For
            additional rules applicable to certain transaction-based
            compensation, see section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv)(A).

        (iii) Examples.

            The following examples illustrate the provisions of this
            paragraph (b)(4). In these examples, except as otherwise
            noted, each employee and each employer has a calendar
            year taxable year and each employee is an individual who
            is employed by the specified employer.

            Example 1.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer Z awards a bonus to
                Employee A such that Employee A has a legally binding
                right to the payment as of November 1, 2008, that is
                not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The
                bonus plan does not provide for a payment date or a
                deferred payment. The bonus plan will not be considered
                to have provided for a deferral of compensation if
                the bonus is paid or made available to Employee A on
                or before March 15, 2009.

            Example 2.

                Employer Y has a taxable year ending August 31. On
                November 1, 2008, Employer Y awards a bonus to Employee
                B so that Employee B has a legally binding right to the
                payment as of November 1, 2008, that is not subject
                to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The bonus plan
                does not provide for a payment date or a deferred
                payment. The bonus plan will not be considered to
                have provided for a deferral of compensation if the
                bonus is paid or made available to Employee B on or
                before November 15, 2009.

            Example 3.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer X awards a bonus to
                Employee C such that Employee C has a legally binding
                right to the payment as of November 1, 2008. Under
                the bonus plan, Employee C will forfeit the bonus
                unless Employee C continues performing services
                through December 31, 2010. The right to the payment is
                subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture through
                December 31, 2010. Employee C has the right to make
                a written election not later than December 31, 2009,
                to receive the bonus on or after December 31, 2015,
                but Employee C does not make such election. The bonus
                plan does not provide for a default payment date or
                a deferred payment in the absence of an election by
                Employee C. The bonus plan will not be considered to
                have provided for a deferral of compensation if the
                bonus is paid or made available to Employee C on or
                before March 15, 2011.

            Example 4.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer W awards a bonus to
                Employee D such that Employee D has a legally binding
                right to the payment as of November 1, 2008. Under
                the bonus plan, the bonus will be determined based on
                services performed during the period from January 1,
                2009 through December 31, 2010. The bonus is scheduled
                to be paid as a lump sum payment on February 15,
                2011. Under the bonus plan, Employee D will forfeit the
                bonus unless Employee D continues performing services
                through the scheduled payment date (February 15,
                2011). Provided that at all times before the scheduled
                payment date Employee D is required to continue to
                perform services to retain the right to the bonus,
                and the bonus is paid on or before March 15, 2012,
                the bonus plan will not be considered to have provided
                for a deferral of compensation.

            Example 5.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer V awards a bonus to
                Employee E such that Employee E has a legally binding
                right to the payment as of November 1, 2008. Under
                the bonus plan, Employee E will forfeit the bonus
                unless Employee E continues performing services
                through December 31, 2010. Under the bonus plan, the
                bonus is scheduled to be paid as a lump sum payment on
                July 1, 2011. By specifying a payment date after the
                applicable 2 1/2 month period, the bonus plan provides
                for a deferred payment. The bonus plan provides for
                a deferral of compensation, and will not qualify as
                a short-term deferral regardless of whether the bonus
                is paid or made available on or before March 15, 2011
                (and generally any payment before June 1, 2011 would
                constitute an impermissible acceleration of a payment).

            Example 6.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer U awards a bonus to
                Employee F such that Employee F has a legally binding
                right to the payment as of November 1, 2008, that is
                not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The
                bonus plan provides for a lump sum payment upon
                Employee F's separation from service. Because the
                separation from service is an event that may occur
                after the applicable 2 1/2 month period, the bonus
                plan provides for a deferred payment and therefore
                provides for a deferral of compensation. Accordingly,
                the bonus plan will not qualify as a short-term
                deferral regardless of whether Employee F separates
                from service and the bonus is paid or made available
                on or before March 15, 2009.

            Example 7.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer T grants Employee G a
                legally binding right to the payment of a life annuity
                with the first annuity payment on November 1, 2013,
                provided that Employee G continues performing services
                for Employer T continuously through November 1,
                2013. Because the life annuity is treated as a single
                payment, and because all payments of the life annuity
                may not occur during the applicable 2 1/2 month period,
                the plan provides for a deferred payment and none of
                the amounts payable under the annuity will qualify as
                a short-term deferral, so that section 409A applies
                to all amounts that are payable under the plan.

            Example 8.

                On November 1, 2008, Employer S grants Employee H
                a stock right providing for an exercise price less
                than the fair market value of the underlying stock
                on November 1, 2008. The stock right is subject to
                a substantial risk of forfeiture requiring services
                through November 1, 2010. The stock right becomes
                exercisable when the substantial risk of forfeiture
                lapses and expires on November 1, 2013. Employee H
                continues providing services through November 1, 2010,
                at which time the substantial risk of forfeiture
                lapses. The stock right provides for a deferred
                payment and will not qualify as a short-term deferral
                regardless of whether Employee H exercises the stock
                right on or before March 15, 2011.

    (5) Stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other
        equity-based compensation---

        (i) Stock rights---

            (A) Nonstatutory stock options not providing for the
                deferral of compensation.

                An option to purchase service recipient stock does
                not provide for a deferral of compensation if---

                (1) The exercise price may never be less than the fair
                    market value of the underlying stock (disregarding
                    lapse restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i))
                    on the date the option is granted and the number
                    of shares subject to the option is fixed on the
                    original date of grant of the option;

                (2) The transfer or exercise of the option is subject
                    to taxation under section 83 and section 1.83-7;
                    and

                (3) The option does not include any feature for the
                    deferral of compensation other than the deferral
                    of recognition of income until the later of
                    the following:

                    (i) The exercise or disposition of the option
                        under section 1.83-7.

                    (ii) The time the stock acquired pursuant to the
                        exercise of the option first becomes
                        substantially vested (as defined in section
                        1.83-3(b)).

            (B) Stock appreciation rights not providing for the
                deferral of compensation.

                A right to compensation based on the appreciation
                in value of a specified number of shares of service
                recipient stock occurring between the date of grant
                and the date of exercise of such right (a stock
                appreciation right) does not provide for a deferral
                of compensation if---

                (1) Compensation payable under the stock appreciation
                    right cannot be greater than the excess of the
                    fair market value of the stock (disregarding lapse
                    restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i))
                    on the date the stock appreciation right is
                    exercised over an amount specified on the date
                    of grant of the stock appreciation right (the
                    stock appreciation right exercise price), with
                    respect to a number of shares fixed on or before
                    the date of grant of the right;

                (2) The stock appreciation right exercise price
                    may never be less than the fair market value
                    of the underlying stock (disregarding lapse
                    restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i))
                    on the date the right is granted; and

                (3) The stock appreciation right does not include
                    any feature for the deferral of compensation other
                    than the deferral of recognition of income until
                    the exercise of the stock appreciation right.

            (C) Stock rights that may provide for the deferral of
                compensation.

                An option to purchase stock other than service
                recipient stock, or a stock appreciation right
                with respect to stock other than service recipient
                stock, generally will provide for the deferral of
                compensation within the meaning of this paragraph
                (b). If under the terms of an option to purchase
                service recipient stock (other than an incentive
                stock option described in section 422 or a stock
                option granted under an employee stock purchase plan
                described in section 423), the exercise price is or
                could become less than the fair market value of the
                stock (disregarding lapse restrictions as defined in
                section 1.83-3(i)) on the date of grant, the grant
                of the option generally will provide for the deferral
                of compensation within the meaning of this paragraph
                (b). If under the terms of a stock appreciation
                right with respect to service recipient stock, the
                compensation payable under the stock appreciation right
                is or could be any amount greater than, with respect
                to a predetermined number of shares, the excess of
                the fair market value of the stock (disregarding
                lapse restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i))
                on the date the stock appreciation right is exercised
                over the fair market value of the stock (disregarding
                lapse restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i))
                on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right,
                the grant of the stock appreciation right generally
                will provide for a deferral of compensation within
                the meaning of this paragraph (b).

            (D) Feature for the deferral of compensation.

                To the extent a stock right provides a right other
                than the right to receive cash or stock on the date
                of exercise and such additional right would otherwise
                allow compensation to be deferred beyond the date
                of exercise, the entire arrangement (including the
                underlying stock right) provides for the deferral
                of compensation. For purposes of this paragraph
                (b)(5)(i), neither the right to receive substantially
                nonvested stock (as defined in section 1.83-3(b)) upon
                the exercise of a stock right, nor the right to pay
                the exercise price with previously acquired shares,
                constitutes a feature for the deferral of compensation.

            (E) Rights to dividends.

                For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(i), the right,
                directly or indirectly contingent upon the exercise
                of a stock right, to receive an amount equal to
                all or part of the dividends or other distributions
                (other than stock dividends described in paragraph
                (b)(5)(v)(H) of this section) declared and paid on the
                number of shares underlying the stock right between
                the date of grant and the date of exercise of the
                stock right constitutes an offset to the exercise
                price of the stock option or an increase in the
                amount payable under the stock appreciation right
                (generally causing such stock right to be subject to
                section 409A). A plan providing a right to dividends
                or other distributions declared and paid on the number
                of shares underlying a stock right, the payment of
                which is not contingent upon, or otherwise payable
                on, the exercise of the stock right, may provide
                for a deferral of compensation, but the existence
                of the right to receive such an amount will not
                be treated as a reduction to the exercise price of
                (or an increase to the compensation payable under)
                the stock right. Thus, a right to such dividends or
                distributions that is not contingent, directly or
                indirectly, upon the exercise of a stock right will
                not cause the related stock right to fail to satisfy
                the requirements of the exclusion from the definition
                of a deferral of compensation provided in paragraphs
                (b)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

        (ii) Statutory stock options.

            The grant of an incentive stock option as described
            in section 422, or the grant of an option under an
            employee stock purchase plan described in section 423
            (including the grant of an option with an exercise price
            discounted in accordance with section 423(b)(6) and the
            accompanying regulations), does not constitute a deferral
            of compensation. However, the exclusion for statutory stock
            options under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii) does not apply to
            a modification, extension, or renewal of a statutory option
            that is treated as the grant of a new option that is not a
            statutory option. See section 1.424-1(e). In such event,
            the option is treated for purposes of this paragraph (b)
            as if it had been a nonstatutory stock option from the date
            of the original grant. Accordingly, if such modification,
            extension, or renewal of the stock option would have
            been treated as the grant of a new option or as causing
            the option to have had a deferral feature from the date
            of grant under paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section, the
            modification, extension, or renewal of the stock option
            is treated as the grant of a new option or as causing
            the option to have had a deferral feature from the date
            of grant for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5).

        (iii) Service recipient stock---

            (A) In general.

                Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs
                (b)(5)(iii)(B), (C), and (D) of this section, the
                term service recipient stock means a class of stock
                that, as of the date of grant, is common stock for
                purposes of section 305 and the regulations thereunder
                of a corporation that is an eligible issuer of service
                recipient stock (as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E)
                of this section). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
                term service recipient stock does not include a class
                of stock that has any preference as to distributions
                other than distributions of service recipient stock
                and distributions in liquidation of the issuer. The
                term service recipient stock also does not include
                any stock that is subject to a mandatory repurchase
                obligation (other than a right of first refusal), or
                a put or call right that is not a lapse restriction
                as defined in section 1.83-3(i), if the stock price
                under such right or obligation is based on a measure
                other than the fair market value (disregarding lapse
                restrictions as defined in section 1.83-3(i)) of the
                equity interest in the corporation represented by
                the stock.

            (B) American depositary receipts.

                An American depositary receipt or American depositary
                share may constitute service recipient stock, to the
                extent that the stock traded on a foreign securities
                market to which the American depositary receipt or
                American depositary share relates qualifies as service
                recipient stock.

            (C) Mutual company units.

                Mutual company units may constitute service recipient
                stock. For this purpose, the term mutual company unit
                means a fixed percentage of the overall value of a
                non-stock mutual company or association. For purposes
                of determining the value of the mutual company unit,
                the unit may be valued in accordance with the rules
                set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section
                governing valuation of service recipient stock the
                shares of which are not traded on an established
                securities market, applied as if the mutual company
                were a stock corporation with one class of common stock
                and the number of shares of such stock determined
                according to such fixed percentage. For example,
                an appreciation right based on the appreciation of
                10 mutual company units, where each unit is defined
                as one percent of the overall value of the mutual
                company, would be valued as if the appreciation right
                were based upon 10 shares of a corporation, with 100
                shares of common stock (and no other class of stock),
                the shares of which are not readily tradable on an
                established securities market.

            (D) Other entities.

                An interest in an entity other than a corporation or
                non-stock mutual company or association may constitute
                service recipient stock to the extent designated
                by the Commissioner in revenue procedures, notices,
                or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue
                Bulletin (see section 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).

            (E) Eligible issuer of service recipient stock---

                (1) In general.

                    The term eligible issuer of service recipient
                    stock means only the corporation for which the
                    service provider provides direct services on
                    the date of grant of the stock right (if the
                    entity receiving such services is a corporation),
                    and any corporation in a chain of corporations
                    or other entities in which each corporation or
                    other entity has a controlling interest in another
                    corporation or other entity in the chain, ending
                    with the corporation or other entity that has a
                    controlling interest in the corporation or other
                    entity for which the service provider provides
                    direct services on the date of grant of the stock
                    right. For this purpose, the term controlling
                    interest has the same meaning as provided in
                    section 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i), provided that the
                    language "at least 50 percent" is used instead
                    of "at least 80 percent" each place it appears
                    in section 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i). In addition,
                    where the use of such stock with respect to the
                    grant of a stock right to such service provider
                    is based upon legitimate business criteria, the
                    term controlling interest has the same meaning as
                    provided in section 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i), provided
                    that the language "at least 20 percent" is used
                    instead of "at least 80 percent" each place it
                    appears in section 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i). For
                    purposes of determining ownership of an
                    interest in an organization, the rules of
                    sections 1.414(c)-3 and 1.414(c)-4 apply. The
                    determination of whether a grant is based on
                    legitimate business criteria is based on the facts
                    and circumstances, focusing primarily on whether
                    there is a sufficient nexus between the service
                    provider and the issuer of the stock right so that
                    the grant serves a legitimate non-tax business
                    purpose other than simply providing compensation
                    to the service provider that is excluded from
                    the requirements of section 409A. For example,
                    stock of a corporation that owns an interest in
                    a joint venture involving an operating business,
                    used with respect to stock rights granted to
                    service providers of the joint venture who are
                    former service providers of such corporation,
                    generally will constitute use of service recipient
                    stock based upon legitimate business criteria,
                    and therefore could constitute service recipient
                    stock with respect to such service providers if
                    the corporation owns at least 20 percent of the
                    joint venture and the other requirements of this
                    paragraph (b)(5)(iii) are met. Similarly, the
                    legitimate business criteria requirement generally
                    would be met if the corporate venturer issued such
                    a right to an employee of the joint venture who
                    it reasonably expected would in the future become
                    an employee of the corporate venturer. However,
                    where a service provider has no real nexus with
                    a corporate venturer, such as generally happens
                    when the corporate venturer is a passive investor
                    in the service recipient joint venture, a stock
                    right issued to that employee on the investor
                    corporation's stock generally would not be based
                    upon legitimate business criteria. Similarly, where
                    a corporation holds only a minority interest in
                    an entity that in turn holds a minority interest
                    in the entity for which the service provider
                    performs services, such that the corporation
                    holds only an insubstantial indirect interest
                    in the entity receiving the services, legitimate
                    business criteria generally would not exist for
                    issuing a stock right on the corporation's stock
                    to the service provider.

                (2) Investment vehicles.

                    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
                    (b)(5)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, except as to
                    a service provider providing services directly to
                    such corporation, for purposes of this paragraph
                    (b)(5), an eligible issuer of service recipient
                    stock does not include any corporation whose
                    primary purpose is to serve as an investment
                    vehicle with respect to the corporation's minority
                    ownership interests in entities other than the
                    service recipient.

                (3) Corporate structures established or transactions
                    undertaken for purposes of avoiding coverage
                    under section 409A.

                    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph
                    (b)(5)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, an eligible
                    issuer of service recipient stock does not include
                    any corporation within a group of entities treated
                    as a single service recipient if a purpose of the
                    establishment of the structure of the ownership,
                    or a purpose of a significant transaction between
                    or among two or more entities comprising a
                    single service recipient, is to provide deferred
                    compensation not subject to the application of
                    section 409A. If an entity becomes a member of a
                    group of corporations or other entities treated
                    as a single service recipient, and the primary
                    source of income or value of such entity arises
                    from the provision of management services to other
                    members of the service recipient group, it is
                    presumed that such structure was established for
                    purposes of avoiding the application of section
                    409A if any stock rights are issued with respect
                    to such entity.

                (4) Substitutions and assumptions by reason of
                    a corporate transaction.

                    If the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(v)(D) of
                    this section are met such that the substitution
                    of a new stock right pursuant to a corporate
                    transaction for an outstanding stock right,
                    or the assumption of an outstanding stock right
                    pursuant to a corporate transaction, would not
                    be treated as the grant of a new stock right or a
                    change in the form of payment for purposes of this
                    section and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6,
                    the stock underlying the stock right that replaced
                    the stock right that is substituted or assumed
                    will be treated as service recipient stock for
                    purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(5) to the
                    replacement stock rights if such underlying stock
                    otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph
                    (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. For example, if by
                    reason of a spinoff transaction (under which the
                    stock of a subsidiary corporation is distributed
                    to the stockholders of a distributing corporation),
                    a stock option to purchase distributing corporation
                    stock is replaced with a stock option to purchase
                    distributing corporation stock and a stock option
                    to purchase the spun off subsidiary corporation's
                    stock (each otherwise satisfying the requirements
                    of paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section),
                    and where such substitution is not treated as a
                    modification of the original stock option pursuant
                    to paragraph (b)(5)(v)(D) of this section, both the
                    distributing corporation stock and the subsidiary
                    corporation stock are treated as service recipient
                    stock for purposes of applying this paragraph
                    (b)(5) to the replacement stock options.

        (iv) Determination of the fair market value of service
            recipient stock---

            (A) Stock readily tradable on an established securities
                market.

                For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section,
                in the case of service recipient stock that is readily
                tradable on an established securities market, the
                fair market value of the stock may be determined
                based upon the last sale before or the first sale
                after the grant, the closing price on the trading day
                before or the trading day of the grant, the arithmetic
                mean of the high and low prices on the trading day
                before or the trading day of the grant, or any other
                reasonable method using actual transactions in such
                stock as reported by such market. The determination
                of fair market value also may be determined using
                an average selling price during a specified period
                that is within 30 days before or 30 days after the
                applicable valuation date, provided that the program
                under which the stock right is granted, including a
                program with a single participant, must irrevocably
                specify the commitment to grant the stock right with an
                exercise price set using such an average selling price
                before the beginning of the specified period. For this
                purpose, the term average selling price refers to the
                arithmetic mean of such selling prices on all trading
                days during the specified period, or the average of
                such prices over the specified period weighted based
                on the volume of trading of such stock on each trading
                day during such specified period. To satisfy this
                requirement, the service recipient must designate the
                recipient of the stock right, the number and class of
                shares of stock that are subject to the stock right,
                and the method for determining the exercise price
                including the period over which the averaging will
                occur, before the beginning of the specified averaging
                period. Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions of this
                paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A), where applicable foreign law
                requires that a compensatory stock right be priced
                based upon a specific price averaging method and
                period, a stock right granted in accordance with such
                applicable foreign law will be treated as meeting the
                requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A), provided
                that the averaging period does not exceed 30 days.

            (B) Stock not readily tradable on an established securities
                market---

                (1) In general.

                    For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this
                    section, in the case of service recipient stock
                    that is not readily tradable on an established
                    securities market, the fair market value of
                    the stock as of a valuation date means a value
                    determined by the reasonable application of a
                    reasonable valuation method. The determination
                    whether a valuation method is reasonable, or
                    whether an application of a valuation method
                    is reasonable, is made based on the facts and
                    circumstances as of the valuation date. Factors to
                    be considered under a reasonable valuation method
                    include, as applicable, the value of tangible
                    and intangible assets of the corporation, the
                    present value of anticipated future cash-flows
                    of the corporation, the market value of stock
                    or equity interests in similar corporations and
                    other entities engaged in trades or businesses
                    substantially similar to those engaged in by the
                    corporation the stock of which is to be valued,
                    the value of which can be readily determined
                    through nondiscretionary, objective means (such
                    as through trading prices on an established
                    securities market or an amount paid in an arm's
                    length private transaction), recent arm's length
                    transactions involving the sale or transfer
                    of such stock or equity interests, and other
                    relevant factors such as control premiums or
                    discounts for lack of marketability and whether
                    the valuation method is used for other purposes
                    that have a material economic effect on the
                    service recipient, its stockholders, or its
                    creditors. The use of a valuation method is not
                    reasonable if such valuation method does not take
                    into consideration in applying its methodology
                    all available information material to the value
                    of the corporation. Similarly, the use of a
                    value previously calculated under a valuation
                    method is not reasonable as of a later date if
                    such calculation fails to reflect information
                    available after the date of the calculation
                    that may materially affect the value of the
                    corporation (for example, the resolution of
                    material litigation or the issuance of a patent)
                    or the value was calculated with respect to a
                    date that is more than 12 months earlier than the
                    date for which the valuation is being used. The
                    service recipient's consistent use of a valuation
                    method to determine the value of its stock or
                    assets for other purposes, including for purposes
                    unrelated to compensation of service providers,
                    is also a factor supporting the reasonableness
                    of such valuation method.

                (2) Presumption of reasonableness.

                    For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B), the
                    use of any of the following methods of valuation
                    is presumed to result in a reasonable valuation,
                    provided that the Commissioner may rebut such
                    a presumption upon a showing that either the
                    valuation method or the application of such method
                    was grossly unreasonable:

                    (i) A valuation of a class of stock determined
                        by an independent appraisal that meets the
                        requirements of section 401(a)(28)(C) and the
                        regulations as of a date that is no more than
                        12 months before the relevant transaction to
                        which the valuation is applied (for example,
                        the date of grant of a stock option).

                    (ii) A valuation based upon a formula that,
                        if used as part of a nonlapse restriction (as
                        defined in section 1.83-3(h)) with respect
                        to the stock, would be considered to be the
                        fair market value of the stock pursuant to
                        section 1.83-5, provided that such stock is
                        valued in the same manner for purposes of any
                        transfer of any shares of such class of stock
                        (or any substantially similar class of stock)
                        to the issuer or any person that owns stock
                        possessing more than 10 percent of the total
                        combined voting power of all classes of stock
                        of the issuer (applying the stock attribution
                        rules of section 1.424-1(d)), other than an
                        arm's length transaction involving the sale
                        of all or substantially all of the outstanding
                        stock of the issuer, and such valuation method
                        is used consistently for all such purposes,
                        and provided further that this paragraph
                        (b)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(ii) does not apply with
                        respect to stock subject to a stock right
                        payable in stock, where the stock acquired
                        pursuant to the exercise of the stock right is
                        transferable other than through the operation
                        of a nonlapse restriction.

                    (iii) A valuation, made reasonably and in good
                        faith and evidenced by a written report
                        that takes into account the relevant factors
                        described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(1) of
                        this section, of illiquid stock of a start-up
                        corporation. For this purpose, illiquid stock
                        of a start-up corporation means service
                        recipient stock of a corporation that has
                        no material trade or business that it or any
                        predecessor to it has conducted for a period
                        of 10 years or more and has no class of equity
                        securities that are traded on an established
                        securities market (as defined in paragraph
                        (k) of this section), where such stock is not
                        subject to any put, call, or other right or
                        obligation of the service recipient or other
                        person to purchase such stock (other than
                        a right of first refusal upon an offer to
                        purchase by a third party that is unrelated
                        to the service recipient or service provider
                        and other than a right or obligation that
                        constitutes a lapse restriction as defined
                        in section 1.83-3(i)), and provided that
                        this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(iii) does
                        not apply to the valuation of any stock if
                        the service recipient or service provider
                        may reasonably anticipate, as of the time
                        the valuation is applied, that the service
                        recipient will undergo a change in control
                        event as described in section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v)
                        or section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vii) within the
                        90 days following the action to which the
                        valuation is applied, or make a public
                        offering of securities within the 180 days
                        following the action to which the valuation
                        is applied. For purposes of this paragraph
                        (b)(5)(iv)(B)(2)(iii), a valuation will not be
                        treated as made reasonably and in good faith
                        unless the valuation is performed by a person
                        or persons that the corporation reasonably
                        determines is qualified to perform such a
                        valuation based on the person's or persons"
                        significant knowledge, experience, education,
                        or training. Generally, a person will be
                        qualified to perform such a valuation if a
                        reasonable individual, upon being apprised
                        of such knowledge, experience, education, and
                        training, would reasonably rely on the advice
                        of such person with respect to valuation in
                        deciding whether to accept an offer to purchase
                        or sell the stock being valued. For this
                        purpose, significant experience generally means
                        at least five years of relevant experience
                        in business valuation or appraisal, financial
                        accounting, investment banking, private equity,
                        secured lending, or other comparable experience
                        in the line of business or industry in which
                        the service recipient operates.

                (3) Use of alternative methods.

                    For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), a different
                    valuation method may be used for each separate
                    action for which a valuation is relevant,
                    provided that a single valuation method is
                    used for each separate action and, once used,
                    may not retroactively be altered. For example,
                    one valuation method may be used to establish the
                    exercise price of a stock option, and a different
                    valuation method may be used to determine the value
                    at the date of the repurchase of stock pursuant
                    to a put or call right. However, once an exercise
                    price or amount to be paid has been established,
                    the exercise price or amount to be paid may not
                    be changed through the retroactive use of another
                    valuation method. In addition, notwithstanding
                    the foregoing, where after the date of grant,
                    but before the date of exercise or transfer,
                    of the stock right, the service recipient stock
                    to which the stock right relates becomes readily
                    tradable on an established securities market,
                    the service recipient must use the valuation
                    method set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A)
                    of this section for purposes of determining the
                    payment at the date of exercise or the purchase
                    of the stock, as applicable.

        (v) Modifications, extensions, substitutions, and assumptions
            of stock rights---

            (A) Treatment of modified and extended stock rights.

                A modification of the terms of a stock right within the
                meaning of paragraph (b)(5)(v)(B) of this section is
                considered to be the grant of a new stock right. The
                new stock right may or may not constitute a deferral
                of compensation under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this
                section, determined at the date of grant of the new
                stock right. If there is an extension of a stock
                right (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)
                of this section), the stock right is treated as having
                had an additional deferral feature from the original
                date of grant of the stock right, and therefore will
                be treated as a plan providing for the deferral of
                compensation from the original grant date for purposes
                of this paragraph (b).

            (B) Modification in general.

                Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of
                this section, the term modification means any change
                in the terms of the stock right (or change in the
                terms of the plan pursuant to which the stock right
                was granted or in the terms of any other agreement
                governing the stock right) that may provide the holder
                of the stock right with a direct or indirect reduction
                in the exercise price of the stock right regardless of
                whether the holder in fact benefits from the change
                in terms. A change in the terms of the stock right
                shortening the period during which the stock right
                is exercisable is not a modification. It is not a
                modification to add a feature providing the ability
                to tender previously acquired stock for the stock
                purchasable under the stock right, or to withhold
                or have withheld shares of stock to facilitate the
                payment of the exercise price or the employment
                taxes or required withholding taxes resulting from
                the exercise of the stock right. In addition, it
                is not a modification for the grantor to exercise
                discretion specifically reserved under a stock right
                with respect to the transferability of the stock right.

            (C) Extensions---

                (1) In general.

                    An extension of a stock right refers to the
                    provision to the holder of an additional period
                    of time within which to exercise the stock right
                    beyond the time originally prescribed under
                    the terms of the stock right, the conversion or
                    exchange of a stock right for a legally binding
                    right to compensation in a future taxable year,
                    or the addition of any feature for the deferral
                    of compensation not permitted in paragraph
                    (b)(5)(i)(A)(3) of this section (in the case of
                    a stock option) or not permitted in paragraph
                    (b)(5)(i)(B)(3) of this section (in the case
                    of a stock appreciation right) to the terms
                    of the stock right, other than at a time when
                    the exercise price of the stock right equals
                    or exceeds the fair market value of the service
                    recipient stock that could be purchased (in the
                    case of an option) or the fair market value of
                    the service recipient stock used to determine the
                    payment to the service provider (in the case of a
                    stock appreciation right), and includes a renewal
                    of such right that has such effect. It is not an
                    extension if the exercise period of a stock right
                    is extended to a date no later than the earlier
                    of the latest date upon which the stock right
                    could have expired by its original terms under
                    any circumstances or the 10th anniversary of the
                    original date of grant of the stock right. If the
                    exercise period of a stock right is extended at a
                    time when the exercise price of the stock right
                    equals or exceeds the fair market value of the
                    service recipient stock that could be purchased
                    (in the case of an option) or the fair market
                    value of the service recipient stock used to
                    determine the payment to the service provider
                    (in the case of a stock appreciation right),
                    it is not an extension of the original stock
                    right. Instead, in such a case, the original stock
                    right is treated as modified rather than extended
                    and a new stock right is treated as having been
                    granted for purposes of this section. In addition,
                    it is not an extension of a stock right if the
                    expiration of the stock right is tolled while the
                    holder cannot exercise the stock right because
                    such an exercise would violate an applicable
                    Federal, state, local, or foreign law, or would
                    jeopardize the ability of the service recipient
                    to continue as a going concern, provided that
                    the period during which the stock right may
                    be exercised is not extended more than 30 days
                    after the exercise of the stock right first would
                    no longer violate an applicable Federal, state,
                    local, and foreign laws or would first no longer
                    jeopardize the ability of the service recipient
                    to continue as a going concern. For this purpose,
                    a provision of foreign law shall be considered
                    applicable only to foreign earned income (as
                    defined under section 911(b)(1) without regard
                    to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without regard to
                    the requirement that the income be attributable to
                    services performed during the period described in
                    section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) from sources within
                    the foreign country that promulgated such law.

                (2) Certain extensions before April 10, 2007.

                    An extension of a stock right before April 10,
                    2007 solely in order to provide the holder of such
                    stock right an additional period of time beyond
                    the time originally prescribed under the terms
                    of such stock right within which to exercise the
                    stock right is disregarded for purposes of applying
                    the rules contained in paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)(1)
                    of this section. For purposes of applying the
                    rules contained in paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)(1) of
                    this section on and after April 10, 2007, such a
                    stock right is treated as having specified at the
                    date of grant the time within which to exercise
                    such stock right that was prescribed under the
                    terms of such stock right in effect on April 10,
                    2007. Nothing in this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)(2)
                    affects any other action treated as the extension
                    of a stock right, including the addition of a
                    deferral feature.

                (3) Examples.

                    The following examples illustrate the provisions
                    of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C). In the examples,
                    each employee is an individual employed by the
                    specified employer, and each employee and each
                    employer has a calendar year taxable year.

                    Example 1.

                        On July 1, 2009, Employer Z grants Employee
                        A a nonstatutory stock option that does not
                        provide for the deferral of compensation in
                        accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of
                        this section. The terms of the nonstatutory
                        stock option provide that the exercise period
                        of the stock option expires on the earlier of
                        July 1, 2019, or 3 months after Employee A's
                        separation from service. On July 1, 2011,
                        Employee A separates from service. On the
                        same day, Employee A and Employer Z change
                        the exercise period of the option so that it
                        expires on July 1, 2013. Because the exercise
                        period of the stock right is not extended
                        beyond July 1, 2019, the change is not an
                        extension for purposes of this paragraph
                        (b)(5)(v)(C).

                    Example 2.

                        The facts are the same as in Example 1 except
                        that Employee A separates from service on
                        July 1, 2018, and on the same day, Employee
                        A and Employer Z change the exercise period
                        of the option so that it expires on July 1,
                        2020. As of July 1, 2018, the fair market
                        value of the underlying stock exceeds the
                        exercise price. Because the exercise period
                        of the stock right is extended beyond July 1,
                        2019, the change is an extension for purposes
                        of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C).

                    Example 3.

                        The facts are the same as in Example 2 except
                        that as of July 1, 2018, the fair market
                        value of the underlying stock is less than
                        the exercise price of the option. Because the
                        exercise period of the stock right is extended
                        at a time when the fair market value of the
                        underlying stock is less than the exercise
                        price, the change is not an extension for
                        purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C) and
                        the change is treated as a modification of
                        the option, resulting in the extension of the
                        exercise period being treated as the grant
                        of a new option on July 1, 2018.

                    Example 4.

                        On July 1, 2009, Employer Y grants to Employee
                        B a stock appreciation right with respect to
                        200 shares of Employer Y common stock that does
                        not provide for the deferral of compensation
                        in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)
                        of this section. Upon exercise of the stock
                        appreciation right, Employee B is entitled to
                        receive the excess of the fair market value
                        of a share of Employer Y common stock on the
                        date of exercise over $100 (the fair market
                        value of a share of Employer Y common stock
                        on July 1, 2009), multiplied by the number
                        of shares with respect to which Employee B is
                        exercising the right. The exercise period of
                        the right expires on the earlier of July 1,
                        2019, or 3 months after Employee B separates
                        from service. Employee B cannot exercise the
                        stock appreciation right with respect to more
                        than 100 shares unless Employee B continues
                        to be employed by Employer Y through June 30,
                        2014. On July 1, 2011, when the fair market
                        value of a share of Employer Y common stock
                        is $200, Employee B and Employer Y amend the
                        stock appreciation right to provide that the
                        right will be exercisable only during calendar
                        year 2018, except that before January 1, 2017,
                        Employee B may elect to designate calendar year
                        2023 or any subsequent calendar year before
                        2033 as the year in which the right will be
                        exercisable. The amendment constitutes an
                        extension of the stock appreciation right
                        under paragraph (b)(5)(v)(C)(1) of this
                        section. Under paragraph (b)(5)(v)(A) of
                        this section, the stock appreciation right is
                        treated as having had an additional deferral
                        feature from the original date of grant
                        (July 1, 2009) of the right, and therefore is
                        treated as a plan providing for the deferral
                        of compensation from that date. During the
                        period from July 1, 2009, through June 30,
                        2011, the provisions of the stock appreciation
                        right relating to the time and form of payment
                        did not satisfy the requirements of section
                        1.409A-3(a). Therefore, the stock appreciation
                        right provides for a deferral of compensation
                        that does not comply with section 409A.

            (D) Substitutions and assumptions of stock rights by
                reason of a corporate transaction.

                If the requirements of section 1.424-1 (without regard
                to the requirement described in section 1.424-1(a)(2)
                that an eligible corporation be the employer of
                the optionee) would be met if the stock right were
                a statutory option, the substitution of a new stock
                right pursuant to a corporate transaction (as defined
                in section 1.424-1(a)(3)) for an outstanding stock
                right or the assumption of an outstanding stock
                right pursuant to a corporate transaction will not
                be treated as the grant of a new stock right or a
                change in the form of payment for purposes of this
                section and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6. For
                purposes of the preceding sentence, the requirement
                of section 1.424-1(a)(5)(iii) will be deemed to be
                satisfied if the ratio of the exercise price to the
                fair market value of the shares subject to the stock
                right immediately after the substitution or assumption
                is not greater than the ratio of the exercise price
                to the fair market value of the shares subject to
                the stock right immediately before the substitution
                or assumption. In the case of a transaction
                described in section 355 in which the stock of the
                distributing corporation and the stock distributed
                in the transaction are both readily tradable on an
                established securities market immediately after
                the transaction, for purposes of this paragraph
                (b)(5)(v), the requirements of section 1.424-1(a)(5)
                related to the fair market value of the stock may be
                satisfied by---

                (1) Using the last sale before or the first sale after
                    the specified date as of which such valuation is
                    being made, the closing price on the last trading
                    day before or the trading day of a specified date,
                    the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices on
                    the last trading day before or the trading day
                    of such specified date, or any other reasonable
                    method using actual transactions in such stock
                    as reported by such market on a specified date,
                    for the stock of the distributing corporation
                    and the stock distributed in the transaction,
                    provided the specified date is designated before
                    such specified date, and such specified date is
                    not more than 60 days after the transaction;

                (2) Using the arithmetic mean of such market prices
                    on trading days during a specified period
                    designated before the beginning of such specified
                    period, where such specified period is not longer
                    than 30 days and ends no later than 60 days after
                    the transaction; or

                (3) Using an average of such prices during such
                    prespecified period weighted based on the volume
                    of trading of such stock on each trading day
                    during such prespecified period.

            (E) Acceleration of date when exercisable.

                Although with respect to a stock right not immediately
                exercisable in full, a change in the terms of the
                right solely to accelerate or delay, within the
                original term of the stock right, the time at which
                the stock right (or any portion of such stock right)
                may be exercised is not a modification for purposes of
                this section, with respect to a stock right subject
                to section 409A, such an acceleration may constitute
                an impermissible acceleration of a payment date under
                section 1.409A-3(j) or a subsequent deferral under
                section 1.409A-2(b).

            (F) Discretionary added benefits.

                If a change to a stock right provides, either by its
                terms or in substance, that the holder may receive
                an additional benefit under the stock right at the
                future discretion of the grantor, and the addition
                of such benefit would constitute a modification or
                extension, then the addition of such discretion is a
                modification or extension at the time that the stock
                right is changed to provide such discretion.

            (G) Change in underlying stock increasing value.

                A change in the terms of the stock subject to a
                stock right that increases the value of the stock
                is a modification of such stock right, except to the
                extent that a new stock right is substituted for such
                stock right by reason of the change in the terms of
                the stock in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(v)(D)
                of this section.

            (H) Change in the number of shares purchasable.

                If a stock right is amended solely to increase
                the number of shares subject to the stock right,
                the increase is not considered a modification of
                the stock right but is treated as the grant of a new
                additional stock right to which the additional shares
                are subject. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
                if the exercise price and number of shares subject to
                a stock right are proportionally adjusted to reflect
                a stock split (including a reverse stock split)
                or stock dividend, and the only effect of the stock
                split or stock dividend is to increase (or decrease)
                on a pro rata basis the number of shares owned by
                each shareholder of the class of stock subject to
                the stock right, then there is no modification of
                the stock right if it is proportionally adjusted to
                reflect the stock split or stock dividend and the
                aggregate exercise price of the stock right is not
                less than the aggregate exercise price before the
                stock split or stock dividend.

            (I) Rescission of changes.

                A change to the terms of a stock right (or change in
                the terms of the plan pursuant to which the stock
                right was granted or in the terms of any other
                agreement governing the right) is not considered a
                modification or extension of the stock right to the
                extent the change in the terms of the stock right is
                rescinded by the earlier of the date the stock right
                is exercised or the last day of the service provider's
                taxable year during which such change occurred. Thus,
                for example, if the terms of a stock right granted to
                an individual employee with a calendar year taxable
                year are changed on March 1 in a manner that would
                result in an extension of the stock right, and the
                change is rescinded on November 1 of the same year, and
                the stock right is not exercised before the change is
                rescinded, the stock right is not considered extended
                under this paragraph (b)(5)(v).

            (J) Successive modifications and extensions.

                The rules of this paragraph (b)(5)(v) apply as well
                to successive modifications and extensions.

            (K) Modifications and extensions in effect on October 23,
                2004.

                For purposes of the application of section 409A and
                these regulations to a stock right, if a legally
                binding right to a modification or extension of
                such stock right existed on October 23, 2004, such
                modification or extension is disregarded, and the
                stock right is treated as if granted with the terms
                and conditions in effect on October 23, 2004.

      (vi) Meaning and use of certain terms---

          (A) Option.

              The term option means the right or privilege of an
              individual to purchase stock from a corporation by
              virtue of an offer of the corporation continuing for a
              stated period of time, whether or not irrevocable, to
              sell such stock at a price determined under paragraph
              (b)(5)(vi)(D) of this section, such individual being
              under no obligation to purchase. While no particular
              form of words is necessary, the option must express an
              offer to sell at the option price, the maximum number
              of shares purchasable under the option, and the period
              of time during which the offer remains open. The term
              option includes a warrant that meets the requirements of
              this paragraph (b)(5)(vi)(A). An option may be granted
              as part of or in conjunction with an employee stock
              purchase plan or subscription contract. An option must be
              in writing (in paper or electronic form) provided that
              such writing is adequate to establish an option right
              or privilege that is enforceable under applicable law.

          (B) Date of grant of option.

              (1) The language the date of grant of the option, and
                  similar phrases, refer to the date when the
                  granting corporation completes the corporate
                  action necessary to create the legally binding
                  right constituting the option. A corporate action
                  creating the legally binding right constituting
                  the option is not considered complete until
                  the date on which the maximum number of shares
                  that can be purchased under the option and the
                  minimum exercise price are fixed or determinable,
                  and the class of underlying stock and the identity
                  of the service provider is designated. Ordinarily,
                  if the corporate action provides for an immediate
                  offer of stock for sale to a service provider,
                  or provides for a particular date on which such
                  offer is to be made, the date of the granting of
                  the option is the date of such corporate action if
                  the offer is to be made immediately, or the date
                  provided as the date of the offer, as the case may
                  be. However, an unreasonable delay in the giving
                  of notice of such offer to the service provider
                  will be taken into account as indicating that the
                  corporation provided that the offer was to be made
                  at the subsequent date on which such notice is given.

              (2) If the corporation imposes a condition on the
                  granting of an option (as distinguished
                  from a condition governing the exercise of
                  the option), such condition generally will be
                  given effect in accordance with the intent of the
                  corporation. However, if the grant of an option is
                  subject to approval by stockholders, the date of
                  grant of the option will be determined as if the
                  option had not been subject to such approval. A
                  condition that does not require corporate action,
                  such as the approval of, or registration with,
                  some regulatory or government agency, for example,
                  a stock exchange or the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission, is ordinarily considered a condition
                  upon the exercise of the option unless the corporate
                  action clearly indicates that the option is not to
                  be granted until such condition has been satisfied.

              (3) In general, a condition imposed upon the exercise
                  of an option will not operate to make ineffective the
                  granting of the option. For example, on June 1, 2008,
                  Corporation A grants to X, an employee, an option to
                  purchase 5,000 shares of the corporation's common
                  stock, exercisable by X on or after June 1, 2009,
                  provided X is employed by the corporation on June
                  1, 2009, and provided that A's profits during the
                  fiscal year preceding the year of exercise exceed
                  $200,000. Such an option is granted to X on June
                  1, 2008, and will be treated as outstanding as of
                  such date.

          (C) Stock.

              The term stock means capital stock of any class,
              including voting or nonvoting common or preferred
              stock. Except as otherwise provided, the term stock
              includes both treasury stock and stock of original
              issue. Special classes of stock authorized to be
              issued to and held by employees are within the scope of
              the term stock for this purpose, provided such stock
              otherwise possesses the rights and characteristics of
              capital stock.

          (D) Exercise price.

              The term exercise price means the consideration in cash
              or property that, pursuant to the terms of the option,
              is the price at which the stock subject to the option
              is purchased. The term exercise price does not include
              any amounts paid as interest under a deferred payment
              plan or treated as interest.

          (E) Exercise.

              The term exercise, when used in reference to an option,
              means the act of acceptance by the holder of the option
              of the offer to sell contained in the option. In general,
              the time of exercise is the time when there is a sale
              or a contract to sell between the corporation and the
              individual. A promise to pay the exercise price does not
              constitute an exercise of the option unless the holder
              of the option is subject to personal liability on such
              promise. An agreement or undertaking by the service
              provider to make payments under a stock purchase plan
              does not constitute the exercise of an option to the
              extent the payments made remain subject to withdrawal
              by or refund to the service provider.

          (F) Transfer.

              The term transfer, when used in reference to the transfer
              to an individual of a share of stock pursuant to the
              exercise of an option, means the transfer of ownership
              of such share, or the transfer of substantially all
              the rights of ownership. Such transfer must, within
              a reasonable time, be evidenced on the books of the
              corporation. A transfer may occur even if a share of
              stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
              or is not otherwise transferable immediately after the
              date of exercise. A transfer does not fail to occur
              merely because, under the terms of the arrangement, the
              individual may not dispose of the share for a specified
              period of time, or the share is subject to a right of
              first refusal or a right to acquire the share at the
              share's fair market value at the time of the sale.

          (G) Readily tradable.

              For purposes of this section and sections 1.409A-2
              through 1.409A-6, stock is treated as readily tradable
              if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making
              a market in such stock.

          (H) Application to stock appreciation rights.

              For purposes of this section and sections 1.409A-2
              through 1.409A-6, the definitions provided in paragraphs
              (b)(5)(vi)(A) through (G) of this section may be applied
              by analogy to the issuance of, exercise of, or payment
              upon the exercise of, a stock appreciation right.

    (6) Restricted property, section 402(b) trusts, and section 403(c)
        annuities---

        (i) In general.

            If a service provider receives property from, or pursuant
            to, a plan maintained by a service recipient, there is
            no deferral of compensation merely because the value of
            the property is not includible in income by reason of
            the property being substantially nonvested (as defined in
            section 1.83-3(b)), or is includible in income solely due
            to a valid election under section 83(b). For purposes of
            this paragraph (b)(6)(i), a transfer of property includes
            the transfer of a beneficial interest in a trust or annuity
            plan, or a transfer to or from a trust or under an annuity
            plan, to the extent such a transfer is subject to section
            83, section 402(b) or section 403(c). In addition, for
            purposes of this paragraph (b), a right to compensation
            income that will be required to be included in income under
            section 402(b)(4)(A) is not a deferral of compensation.

        (ii) Promises to transfer property.

            A plan under which a service provider obtains a legally
            binding right to receive property in a future taxable
            year where the property will be substantially vested (as
            defined in section 1.83-3(b)) at the time of transfer of
            the property may provide for the deferral of compensation
            and, accordingly, may constitute a nonqualified deferred
            compensation plan. A legally binding right to receive
            property in a future taxable year where the property
            will be substantially nonvested (as defined in section
            1.83-3(b)) at the time of transfer of the property will not
            provide for the deferral of compensation and, accordingly,
            will not constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation
            plan unless offered in conjunction with another legally
            binding right that constitutes a deferral of compensation.

    (7) Arrangements between partnerships and partners. [Reserved]

    (8) Certain foreign plans---

        (i) Plans with respect to compensation covered by treaty or
            other international agreement.

            A plan in which a service provider participates does not
            provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes of
            this paragraph (b) to the extent that the compensation
            under the plan would have been excluded from gross income
            for Federal income tax purposes under the provisions of
            any bilateral income tax convention or other bilateral
            or multilateral agreement to which the United States is
            a party if the compensation had been paid to the service
            provider at the time that the legally binding right to
            the compensation first arose or, if later, the time that
            the legally binding right was no longer subject to a
            substantial risk of forfeiture.

        (ii) Plans with respect to certain other compensation.

            A plan in which a service provider participates does not
            provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes of
            this paragraph (b) to the extent that compensation under
            the plan would not have been includible in gross income
            for Federal tax purposes if it had been paid to the
            service provider at the time that the legally binding
            right to the compensation first arose or, if later,
            the time that the legally binding right was no longer
            subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, due to one
            of the following:

            (A) The service provider was a nonresident alien at such
                time and the compensation would not have been
                includible in gross income under section 872.

            (B) The service provider was a qualified individual
                (as defined in section 911(d)(1)) at such time, the
                compensation would have been foreign earned income
                within the meaning of section 911(b)(1) (without regard
                to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv)) if paid at such time,
                and the amount of such compensation was equal to or
                less than the excess (if any) of the maximum exclusion
                amount under section 911(b)(2)(D) for such taxable
                year over the amount of foreign earned income actually
                excluded from gross income by such qualified individual
                for such taxable year under section 911(a)(1).

            (C) The compensation would have been excludible from
                gross income under section 893.

            (D) The compensation would have been excludible from
                gross income under section 931 or section 933.

        (iii) Tax equalization agreements.

            A tax equalization agreement does not provide for a
            deferral of compensation if payments made under such
            tax equalization agreement are made no later than the
            end of the second taxable year of the service provider
            beginning after the taxable year of the service provider
            in which the service provider's U.S. Federal income tax
            return is required to be filed (including any extensions)
            for the year to which the compensation subject to the tax
            equalization payment relates, or, if later, the second
            taxable year of the service provider beginning after the
            latest such taxable year in which the service provider's
            foreign tax return or payment is required to be filed or
            made for the year to which the compensation subject to
            the tax equalization payment relates. Where such payments
            arise due to an audit, litigation or similar proceeding,
            the right to the payments will not be treated as resulting
            in a deferral of compensation if the payments are scheduled
            and made in accordance with the provisions of section
            1.409A-3(i)(1)(v) (timing of tax gross-up payments). For
            purposes of this paragraph (b)(8)(iii), the term tax
            equalization agreement refers to an agreement, method,
            program, or other arrangement that provides payments
            intended to compensate the service provider for some
            or all of the excess of the taxes actually imposed by
            a foreign jurisdiction on the compensation paid by the
            service recipient to the service provider over the taxes
            that would be imposed if the compensation were subject
            solely to United States Federal, state, and local income
            tax, or some or all of the excess of the United States
            Federal, state, and local income tax actually imposed
            on the compensation paid by the service to the service
            provider over the taxes that would be imposed if the
            compensation were subject solely to taxes in the foreign
            jurisdiction, provided that the payment made under such
            agreement, method, program, or other arrangement may not
            exceed such excess and the amount necessary to compensate
            for the additional taxes on the amount paid under the
            agreement, method, program, or other arrangement.

        (iv) Certain limited deferrals of a nonresident alien.

            With respect to a nonresident alien, a foreign plan
            does not provide for a deferral of compensation if
            the amounts deferred under the foreign plan based
            upon services performed by the nonresident alien in
            the United States (including amounts deferred based
            upon service credits or compensation received due to
            services performed in the United States) do not exceed
            the applicable dollar amount under section 402(g)(1)(B)
            for the taxable year. If the amounts deferred under
            the foreign plan based upon the services performed by
            the nonresident alien in the United States exceed the
            applicable dollar amount, an amount of such deferrals
            equal to such amount is treated as not deferred under a
            nonqualified deferred compensation plan. For purposes of
            this paragraph (b)(8)(iv), the term foreign plan means a
            plan that, together with all substantially similar plans,
            is maintained by a service recipient for a substantial
            number of participants, substantially all of whom are
            nonresident aliens or resident aliens classified as
            resident aliens solely under section 7701(b)(1)(A)(ii)
            (and not section 7701(b)(1)(A)(i)).

        (v) Additional foreign plans.

            A plan in which a service provider participates does
            not provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes
            of this paragraph (b) to the extent designated by the
            Commissioner in revenue procedures, notices, or other
            guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin
            (see section 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).

        (vi) Earnings.

            Earnings on compensation excluded from the definition
            of deferral of compensation pursuant to this paragraph
            (b)(8) are also not treated as a deferral of compensation.

    (9) Separation pay plans---

        (i) In general.

            A plan that otherwise provides for a deferral of
            compensation under this paragraph (b) does not fail to
            provide a deferral of compensation merely because the
            right to payment of the compensation is conditioned upon a
            separation from service. However, paragraphs (b)(9)(ii),
            (iii), (iv), and (v) of this section provide rules
            concerning the extent to which certain separation pay
            plans do not provide for the deferral of compensation. The
            exceptions contained in paragraphs (b)(9)(ii), (iii), (iv),
            and (v) of this section may be used in combination, such
            that compensation under a plan that would be excepted under
            one of those paragraphs may be treated as excepted under
            another of those paragraphs, so that other compensation
            under a plan may be treated as excepted under the first
            of such paragraphs. Notwithstanding any other provision
            of this paragraph (b)(9), any payment or benefit,
            or entitlement to a payment or benefit, that acts as a
            substitute for, or replacement of, amounts deferred by the
            service recipient under a separate nonqualified deferred
            compensation plan constitutes a payment or a deferral
            of compensation under the separate nonqualified deferred
            compensation plan, and does not constitute a payment or
            deferral of compensation under a separation pay plan. If
            a service provider receives a payment at separation from
            service and also has a legally binding right to an amount
            of deferred compensation that would be forfeited upon
            the separation from service, whether the payment acts
            as an acceleration of vesting and substitute payment
            for the amount of deferred compensation forfeited, or
            whether the deferred compensation is treated as forfeited
            and the amount paid is treated as a separate payment of
            current compensation, is determined based on the facts and
            circumstances, provided that, where the separation from
            service is voluntary, it is presumed that the payment
            results from an acceleration of vesting followed by a
            payment of the deferred compensation that is subject to
            section 409A. Accordingly, any change in the payment
            schedule to accelerate or defer the payments would be
            subject to the rules of section 409A. The presumption that
            a right to a payment is not a new right, but is instead
            a right substituted for a pre-existing forfeited right,
            may be rebutted by demonstrating that the service provider
            would have obtained the right to the payment regardless of
            the forfeiture of the nonvested right. A factor indicating
            that the service provider would have obtained a right to
            a payment regardless of the forfeiture of the nonvested
            right is that the amount to which the service provider
            obtains a right is materially less than an amount equal
            to the present value of the forfeited amount multiplied
            by a fraction, the numerator of which is the period of
            service the service provider actually completed, and the
            denominator of which is the full period of service the
            service provider would have been required to complete to
            receive the full amount of the payment. For example, where
            a service provider is entitled to a future payment only
            if the service provider completes three years of service
            and at the time of termination the service provider has
            completed one year of service, the presumption could
            be rebutted if the payment to the service provider is
            materially less than the present value of one-third of the
            nonvested amount. Another such factor is that the payment
            to the service provider is of a type customarily made
            to service providers who separate from service with the
            service recipient and do not forfeit nonvested rights to
            deferred compensation (for example, a payment of accrued
            but unused leave or a payment for a release of actual or
            potential claims).

        (ii) Collectively bargained separation pay plans.

            A separation pay plan does not provide for a deferral
            of compensation to the extent the plan is a collectively
            bargained separation pay plan that provides for separation
            pay only upon an involuntary separation from service or
            pursuant to a window program. Only the portion of the
            separation pay plan attributable to employees covered by
            a bona fide collective bargaining agreement is considered
            to be provided under a collectively bargained separation
            pay plan. A collectively bargained separation pay plan is
            a separation pay plan that meets the following conditions:

            (A) The separation pay plan is contained within an
                agreement that the Secretary of Labor determines to
                be a collective bargaining agreement.

            (B) The separation pay provided by the collective
                bargaining agreement was the subject of arm's length
                negotiations between employee representatives and one
                or more employers, and the agreement between employee
                representatives and one or more employers satisfies
                section 7701(a)(46).

            (C) The circumstances surrounding the agreement evidence
                good faith bargaining between adverse parties over
                the separation pay to be provided under the agreement.

        (iii) Separation pay due to involuntary separation from service
            or participation in a window program.

            A separation pay plan that is not described in paragraph
            (b)(9)(ii) of this section and that provides for separation
            pay only upon an involuntary separation from service (as
            defined in paragraph (n) of this section) or pursuant
            to a window program does not provide for a deferral of
            compensation to the extent that the separation pay, or
            portion of the separation pay, provided under the plan
            meets the following requirements:

            (A) The separation pay (other than amounts described in
                paragraphs (b)(9)(iv) and (v) of this section) does
                not exceed two times the lesser of---

                (1) The sum of the service provider's annualized
                    compensation based upon the annual rate of pay for
                    services provided to the service recipient for the
                    taxable year of the service provider preceding the
                    taxable year of the service provider in which the
                    service provider has a separation from service
                    with such service recipient (adjusted for any
                    increase during that year that was expected to
                    continue indefinitely if the service provider
                    had not separated from service); or

                (2) The maximum amount that may be taken into account
                    under a qualified plan pursuant to section
                    401(a)(17) for the year in which the service
                    provider has a separation from service.

            (B) The plan provides that the separation pay described in
                paragraph (b)(9)(iii)(A) of this section must be paid
                no later than the last day of the second taxable year
                of the service provider following the taxable year of
                the service provider in which occurs the separation
                from service.

        (iv) Foreign separation pay plans. A separation pay plan
            (including a plan providing payments upon a voluntary
            separation from service) does not provide for deferred
            compensation to the extent the plan provides for amounts
            of separation pay required to be provided under the
            applicable law of a foreign jurisdiction. For this purpose,
            a provision of foreign law shall be considered applicable
            only to foreign earned income (as defined under section
            911(b)(1) without regard to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv)
            and without regard to the requirement that the income
            be attributable to services performed during the period
            described in section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) from sources
            within the foreign country that promulgated such law.

        (v) Reimbursements and certain other separation payments---

            (A) In general.

                To the extent a separation pay plan (including a plan
                providing payments upon a voluntary separation from
                service) entitles a service provider to payment by
                the service recipient of reimbursements that are not
                otherwise excludible from gross income for expenses
                that the service provider could otherwise deduct
                under section 162 or section 167 as business expenses
                incurred in connection with the performance of services
                (ignoring any applicable limitation based on adjusted
                gross income), or of reasonable outplacement expenses
                and reasonable moving expenses actually incurred
                by the service provider and directly related to the
                termination of services for the service recipient, such
                plan does not provide for a deferral of compensation to
                the extent such rights apply during a limited period of
                time (regardless of whether such rights extend beyond
                the limited period of time). For purposes of this
                paragraph (b)(9)(v)(A), the reimbursement of reasonable
                moving expenses includes the reimbursement of all or
                part of any loss the service provider actually incurs
                due to the sale of a primary residence in connection
                with a separation from service.

            (B) Medical benefits.

                To the extent a separation pay plan (including a plan
                providing payments due to a voluntary separation from
                service) entitles a service provider to reimbursement
                by the service recipient of payments of medical
                expenses incurred and paid by the service provider
                but not reimbursed by a person other than the service
                recipient and allowable as a deduction under section
                213 (disregarding the requirement of section 213(a)
                that the deduction is available only to the extent
                that such expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross
                income), such plan does not provide for a deferral of
                compensation to the extent such rights apply during the
                period of time during which the service provider would
                be entitled (or would, but for such plan, be entitled)
                to continuation coverage under a group health plan
                of the service recipient under section 4980B (COBRA)
                if the service provider elected such coverage and
                paid the applicable premiums.

            (C) In-kind benefits and direct service recipient
                payments.

                A service provider's entitlement to in-kind benefits
                from the service recipient, or a payment by the service
                recipient directly to the person providing the goods
                or services to the service provider, is treated as not
                providing for a deferral of compensation for purposes
                of this paragraph (b), if a right to reimbursement by
                the service recipient for a payment for such benefits,
                goods, or services by the service provider would not
                be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation
                under this paragraph (b)(9)(v).

            (D) Limited payments.

                If not otherwise excluded, a taxpayer may treat a
                right or rights under a separation pay plan to a
                payment or payments as not providing for a deferral
                of compensation to the extent such payments in
                the aggregate do not exceed the applicable dollar
                amount under section 402(g)(1)(B) for the year of
                the separation from service.

            (E) Limited period of time.

                For purposes of paragraphs (b)(9)(v)(A) and (C) of this
                section, a limited period of time in which expenses
                may be incurred, or in which in-kind benefits may be
                provided by the service recipient or a third party
                that the service recipient will pay, does not include
                periods beyond the last day of the second taxable year
                of the service provider following the taxable year
                of the service provider in which the separation from
                service occurred, provided that the period during which
                the reimbursements for such expenses must be paid may
                not extend beyond the third taxable year of the service
                provider following the taxable year of the service
                provider in which the separation from service occurred.

        (vi) Window programs---definition.

            The term window program refers to a program established
            by a service recipient in connection with an impending
            separation from service to provide separation pay, where
            such program is made available by the service recipient
            for a limited period of time (no longer than 12 months)
            to service providers who separate from service during that
            period or to service providers who separate from service
            during that period under specified circumstances. A program
            will not be considered a window program if a service
            recipient establishes a pattern of repeatedly providing
            for similar separation pay in similar situations for
            substantially consecutive, limited periods of time. Whether
            the recurrence of these programs constitutes a pattern is
            determined based on the facts and circumstances. Although
            no one factor is determinative, relevant factors include
            whether the benefits are on account of a specific business
            event or condition, the degree to which the separation pay
            relates to the event or condition, and whether the event
            or condition is temporary or discrete or is a permanent
            aspect of the employer's business.

    (10) Certain indemnification and liability insurance plans.

        A plan in which a service provider participates does not
        provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes of
        this paragraph (b) to the extent that the plan provides
        (to the extent permissible under applicable law), for the
        indemnification of, or the purchase of an insurance policy
        providing for payments of, all or part of the expenses incurred
        or damages paid or payable by a service provider with respect
        to a bona fide claim against the service provider or service
        recipient, including amounts paid or payable by the service
        provider upon the settlement of a bona fide claim against the
        service provider or service recipient, where such claim is
        based on actions or failures to act by the service provider
        in his or her capacity as a service provider of the service
        recipient.

    (11) Legal settlements.

        An agreement to which a service provider is a party does
        not provide for a deferral of compensation for purposes of
        this paragraph (b) to the extent that the agreement provides
        for amounts paid as settlements or awards resolving bona
        fide legal claims based on wrongful termination, employment
        discrimination, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or worker's
        compensation statutes, including claims under applicable
        Federal, state, local, or foreign laws, or for reimbursements
        or payments of reasonable attorneys fees or other reasonable
        expenses incurred by the service provider related to such bona
        fide legal claims, regardless of whether such settlements,
        awards, or reimbursement or payment of expenses pursuant to
        such claims are treated as compensation or wages for Federal
        tax purposes. Whether the execution of a waiver of any or
        all of such types of claims indicates that the amounts are
        paid as an award or settlement of an actual bona fide claim
        for damages under applicable law is determined based on the
        facts and circumstances. This paragraph (b)(11) does not apply
        to any deferred amounts that did not arise as a result of an
        actual bona fide claim for damages under applicable law, such
        as amounts that would have been deferred or paid regardless of
        the existence of such claim, even if such amounts are paid or
        modified as part of a settlement or award resolving an actual
        bona fide claim. For this purpose, a provision of foreign law
        shall be considered applicable only to foreign earned income
        (as defined under section 911(b)(1) without regard to section
        911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without regard to the requirement that
        the income be attributable to services performed during the
        period described in section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) from sources
        within the foreign country that promulgated such law.

    (12) Certain educational benefits.

        A plan in which a service provider participates does not
        provide for a deferral of compensation to the extent the
        plan provides for taxable educational benefits. For purposes
        of this paragraph (b)(12), the term educational benefits
        refers solely to benefits provided to a service provider,
        consisting solely of educational assistance for the education
        of the service provider, as defined in section 127(c) and the
        accompanying regulations, and does not refer to any benefits
        provided for the education of any other person, including any
        spouse, child, or other family member of the service provider.

(c) Plan---

    (1) In general.

        The term plan includes any agreement, method, program,
        or other arrangement, including an agreement, method,
        program, or other arrangement that applies to one person or
        individual. A plan may be adopted unilaterally by the service
        recipient or may be negotiated or agreed to by the service
        recipient and one or more service providers or service
        provider representatives. An agreement, method, program,
        or other arrangement may constitute a plan regardless of
        whether it is an employee benefit plan under section 3(3)
        of ERISA, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1002(3)). The requirements
        of section 409A are applied as if a separate plan or plans
        is maintained for each service provider. For purposes of
        determining the terms of a plan, general provisions of the
        plan that purport to nullify noncompliant plan terms, or
        to supply any specific plan terms required by this section,
        section 1.409A-2 or section 1.409A-3, are disregarded.

    (2) Plan aggregation rules---

        (i) In general.

            Except as otherwise provided, the following rules
            apply with respect to the application of this section
            and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6 to deferrals of
            compensation with respect to a service provider:

            (A) All deferrals of compensation at the election of that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient that are account balance plans, except to
                the extent that the plan is described in paragraph
                (c)(2)(i)(D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) of this section,
                are treated as deferred under a single plan. For
                purposes of this paragraph, the term account balance
                plan means---

                (1) An agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                    that is an account balance plan as defined in
                    section 31.3121(v)(2)-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this
                    chapter, including mandatorily bifurcating the
                    agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                    in accordance with the rules provided in section
                    31.3121(v)-1(c)(1)(iii)(B) of this chapter; or

                (2) An agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                    that would be described in paragraph
                    (c)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section if the service
                    provider were an employee.

            (B) All deferrals of compensation other than at the
                election of that service provider, including deferrals
                reflecting matching by the service recipient with
                respect to amounts a service provider elects to defer,
                under all plans of the service recipient that are
                account balance plans, except to the extent the plan
                is described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D), (E), (F),
                (G), or (H) of this section, are treated as deferred
                under a single plan. For purposes of this paragraph
                (c)(2)(i)(B), the term "account balance plan" has the
                same meaning as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)
                of this section.

            (C) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient that are nonaccount balance plans, except
                to the extent such plan is described in paragraph
                (c)(2)(i)(D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) of this section,
                are treated as deferred under a single plan. For
                purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C), the term
                nonaccount balance plan means---

                (1) An agreement, method, program, or other
                    arrangement that is a nonaccount balance plan as
                    defined in section 31.3121(v)(2)-1(c)(2)(i) of this
                    chapter, including mandatorily bifurcating the
                    agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                    in accordance with the rules provided in section
                    31.3121(v)-1(c)(1)(iii)(B) of this chapter; or

                (2) An agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                    that would be described in paragraph
                    (c)(2)(i)(C)(1) of this section if the service
                    provider were an employee.

            (D) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all separation pay plans
                (as defined in paragraph (m) of this section) of the
                service recipient to the extent an amount deferred
                under the plans is not described in paragraph
                (c)(2)(i)(E) of this section and is payable solely
                upon an involuntary separation from service within
                the meaning of paragraph (n) of this section or as
                a result of participation in a window program, are
                treated as deferred under a single plan.

            (E) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient to the extent such amounts deferred consist
                of rights to in-kind benefits or reimbursements
                of expenses, such as membership fees, or expenses
                related to aircraft or vehicle usage, to the extent
                that the right to the in-kind benefit or reimbursement,
                separately or in the aggregate, does not constitute a
                substantial portion of either the overall compensation
                earned by the service provider for performing services
                for the service recipient or the overall compensation
                received due to a separation from service, are treated
                as deferred under a single plan.

            (F) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient to the extent that the taxation of such
                compensation is governed by section 1.61-22 or
                section 1.7872-15 (split-dollar life insurance
                arrangements), or the taxation of such compensation
                would be governed by section 1.61-22 or section
                1.7872-15 but for the operation of section 1.61-22(j)
                (effective date provisions), are treated as deferred
                under a single plan.

            (G) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all agreements, methods,
                programs, or other arrangements of the service
                recipient to the extent the deferrals under the
                agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements
                are deferrals of amounts that would be treated as
                modified foreign earned income (meaning foreign earned
                income as defined under section 911(b)(1) without
                regard to section 911(b)(1)(B)(iv) and without regard
                to the requirement that the income be attributable
                to services performed during the period described in
                section 911(d)(1)(A) or (B)) if paid to the service
                provider at the time the amount is first deferred,
                and provided further that substantially all the
                participants in such agreements, methods, programs,
                or other arrangements and any substantially similar
                agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements
                are nonresident aliens and that the service provider
                does not participate in a substantially identical
                agreement, method, program, or other arrangement that
                does not meet the requirements of this paragraph
                (c)(2)(i)(G) (a domestic arrangement), are treated
                as deferred under a single plan.

            (H) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient to the extent such plans are stock rights
                (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) subject
                to section 409A, are treated as deferred under a
                single plan.

            (I) All deferrals of compensation with respect to that
                service provider under all plans of the service
                recipient to the extent such plans are not described
                in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F),
                (G), or (H) of this section are treated as deferred
                under a single plan.

        (ii) Dual status.

            Agreements, methods, programs, and other arrangements
            in which a service provider participates are not
            aggregated with other agreements, methods, programs,
            and other arrangements to the extent the service provider
            participates in one set of agreements, methods, programs,
            and other arrangements due to status as an employee of the
            service recipient (employee arrangements) and another set
            of agreements, methods, programs, and other arrangements
            due to status as an independent contractor of the service
            recipient (independent contractor arrangements). For
            example, where a service provider deferred amounts under
            an independent contractor arrangement while providing
            services as an independent contractor, and then becomes
            eligible for and defers amounts under a separate employee
            arrangement after being hired as an employee, the two
            arrangements will not be aggregated for purposes of this
            paragraph (c)(2). Where an employee also is a member of
            the board of directors of the service recipient (or a
            similar position with respect to a non-corporate service
            recipient), the arrangements under which the employee
            participates as a director (director arrangements) are
            not aggregated with employee arrangements, provided that
            the director arrangements are substantially similar to
            arrangements provided to service providers providing
            services only as directors (or similar positions with
            respect to non-corporate service recipients). For example,
            an employee director who participates in an employee
            arrangement and a director arrangement generally may
            treat the two arrangements as separate plans, provided
            that the director arrangement is substantially similar
            to arrangements providing benefits to non-employee
            directors. To the extent a plan in which an employee
            director participates is not substantially similar to
            arrangements in which non-employee directors participate,
            such plan is treated as an employee plan for purposes of
            this paragraph (c)(2). Director plans and independent
            contractor plans are aggregated for purposes of this
            paragraph (c)(2).

    (3) Establishment of plan---

        (i) In general.

            A plan does not satisfy the requirements of section 409A
            and this section and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-3
            and sections 1.409A-5 through 1.409A-6, unless the plan
            is established and maintained by a service recipient
            in accordance with the requirements of this section,
            sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-3 and sections 1.409A-5
            through 1.409A-6. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3),
            a plan is established on the latest of the date on
            which it is adopted, the date on which it is effective,
            and the date on which the material terms of the plan are
            set forth in writing. The material terms of the plan may
            be set forth in writing in one or more documents. For
            purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i), a plan will be
            deemed to be set forth in writing if it is set forth in
            any other form that is approved by the Commissioner. The
            material terms of the plan include the amount (or the
            method or formula for determining the amount) of deferred
            compensation to be provided under the plan and the time
            and form of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
            plan will be deemed to be established as of the date the
            participant obtains a legally binding right to a deferral
            of compensation, provided that the plan is otherwise
            established under the rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)
            by the end of the taxable year of the service provider in
            which the legally binding right arises, or with respect to
            an amount not payable in the year immediately following
            the taxable year of the service provider in which the
            legally binding right arises (the subsequent year),
            the 15th day of the third month of the subsequent year.

        (ii) Initial deferral election provisions.

            If a plan provides a service provider or a service
            recipient with an initial deferral election, the plan
            satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) if
            the plan sets forth in writing, on or before the date
            the applicable election is required to be irrevocable
            to satisfy the requirements of section 1.409A-2(a),
            the conditions under which such election may be made.

        (iii) Subsequent deferral election provisions.

            If a plan permits a subsequent deferral election
            described in section 1.409A-2(b), the plan satisfies the
            requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) if the plan sets
            forth in writing, on or before the date the election
            is required to be irrevocable to meet the requirements
            of section 1.409A-2(b), the conditions under which such
            election may be made.

        (iv) Payment accelerations.

            Except as explicitly provided in section 1.409A-3, a plan
            is not required to set forth in writing the conditions
            under which a payment may be accelerated if such
            acceleration is permitted under section 1.409A-3(j)(4).

        (v) Six-month delay for specified employees.

            A plan must provide that distributions to a specified
            employee may not be made before the date that is six months
            after the date of separation from service or, if earlier,
            the date of death (the six-month delay rule). The six-month
            delay rule, required for payments due to the separation
            from service of a specified employee, must be written
            in the plan. A plan does not fail to be established
            and maintained merely because it does not contain the
            six-month delay rule when the service provider who has
            a right to compensation deferred under such plan is not
            a specified employee. However, such provision must be
            set forth in writing on or before the date such service
            provider first becomes a specified employee. In general,
            this means the provision must be set forth in writing on or
            before the specified employee effective date (as defined
            in paragraph (i)(3) of this section) for the first list
            of specified employees that includes such service provider.

        (vi) Plan amendments.

            In the case of an amendment that increases the amount
            deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan,
            the plan is not considered established with respect to the
            additional amount deferred until the plan, as amended,
            is established in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)
            of this section.

        (vii) Transition rule for written plan requirement.

            For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), a legally
            enforceable unwritten plan that was adopted and effective
            before December 31, 2007, is treated as established under
            this section as of the later of the date on which it was
            adopted or became effective, provided that the material
            terms of the plan are set forth in writing on or before
            December 31, 2007.

        (viii) Plan aggregation rules.

            The plan aggregation rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i)
            of this section do not apply to the written plan
            requirements of this paragraph (c)(3). Accordingly,
            deferrals of compensation under an agreement, method,
            program, or other arrangement that fails to meet the
            requirements of section 409A solely due to a failure
            to meet the written plan requirements of this paragraph
            (c)(3) are not aggregated with deferrals of compensation
            under other agreements, methods, programs, or other
            arrangements that meet such requirements.

(d) Substantial risk of forfeiture---

    (1) In general.

        Compensation is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if
        entitlement to the amount is conditioned on the performance of
        substantial future services by any person or the occurrence
        of a condition related to a purpose of the compensation, and
        the possibility of forfeiture is substantial. For purposes of
        this paragraph (d), a condition related to a purpose of the
        compensation must relate to the service provider's performance
        for the service recipient or the service recipient's
        business activities or organizational goals (for example, the
        attainment of a prescribed level of earnings or equity value
        or completion of an initial public offering). For purposes
        of this paragraph (d), if a service provider's entitlement
        to the amount is conditioned on the occurrence of the service
        provider's involuntary separation from service without cause,
        the right is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if
        the possibility of forfeiture is substantial. An amount is not
        subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture merely because the
        right to the amount is conditioned, directly or indirectly,
        upon the refraining from the performance of services. Except as
        provided with respect to certain transaction-based compensation
        under section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(iv), the addition of any risk of
        forfeiture after the legally binding right to the compensation
        arises, or any extension of a period during which compensation
        is subject to a risk of forfeiture, is disregarded for
        purposes of determining whether such compensation is subject
        to a substantial risk of forfeiture. An amount will not be
        considered subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture beyond
        the date or time at which the recipient otherwise could have
        elected to receive the amount of compensation, unless the
        present value of the amount subject to a substantial risk of
        forfeiture (disregarding, in determining the present value,
        the risk of forfeiture) is materially greater than the
        present value of the amount the recipient otherwise could
        have elected to receive absent such risk of forfeiture. For
        this purpose, compensation that the service provider would
        receive for continuing to perform services regardless of
        whether the service provider elected to receive the amount
        that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture is not
        taken into account in determining whether the present value
        of the right to the amount subject to a substantial risk of
        forfeiture is materially greater than the amount the recipient
        otherwise could have elected to receive absent such risk of
        forfeiture. For example, a salary deferral generally may not
        be made subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. But, for
        example, where a bonus plan provides an election between a cash
        payment or restricted stock units with a present value that
        is materially greater (disregarding the risk of forfeiture)
        than the present value of such cash payment and that will be
        forfeited absent continued services for a period of years,
        the right to the restricted stock units generally will be
        treated as subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

    (2) Stock rights.

        A stock right is not subject to a substantial risk of
        forfeiture at the earlier of the first date the holder may
        exercise the stock right and receive cash or property that
        is substantially vested (as defined in section 1.83-3(b))
        or the first date that the stock right is not subject to a
        forfeiture condition that would constitute a substantial
        risk of forfeiture. Accordingly, a stock option that the
        service provider may exercise immediately and receive
        substantially vested stock is not subject to a substantial
        risk of forfeiture, even if the stock option automatically
        terminates upon the service provider's separation from service.

    (3) Enforcement of forfeiture condition---

        (i) In general.

            In determining whether the possibility of forfeiture is
            substantial in the case of rights to compensation granted
            by a service recipient to a service provider that owns a
            significant amount of the total combined voting power or
            value of all classes of equity of the service recipient
            (where the service provider's ownership is determined
            with application of the attribution rules under section
            318 if the service recipient is a corporation, or if the
            service recipient is an entity that is not a corporation,
            with application by analogy of the attribution rules under
            section 318), all relevant facts and circumstances will be
            taken into account in determining whether the probability
            of the service recipient enforcing such condition is
            substantial, including---

            (A) The service provider's relationship to other equity
                holders and the extent of their control, potential
                control and possible loss of control of the service
                recipient;

            (B) The position of the service provider in the service
                recipient and the extent to which the service provider
                is subordinate to other service providers;

            (C) The service provider's relationship to the officers and
                directors of the service recipient (or similar
                positions with respect to a noncorporate service
                recipient);

            (D) The person or persons who must approve the service
                provider's discharge; and

            (E) Past actions of the service recipient in enforcing
                the restrictions.

        (ii) Examples.

            The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph
            (d)(3)(i) of this section:

            Example 1.

                A service provider would be considered as having
                deferred compensation subject to a substantial risk
                of forfeiture, but for the fact that the service
                provider owns 20 percent of the single class of stock
                in the transferor corporation. If the remaining 80
                percent of the class of stock is owned by an unrelated
                individual (or members of such an individual's family)
                so that the possibility of the corporation enforcing
                a restriction on such rights is substantial, then such
                rights are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

            Example 2.

                A service provider would be considered as having
                deferred compensation subject to a substantial risk
                of forfeiture, but for the fact that the service
                provider, who is president of the corporation, also
                owns 4 percent of the voting power of all the stock of
                a corporation. If the remaining stock is so diversely
                held by the public that the president, in effect,
                controls the corporation, then the possibility of
                the corporation enforcing a restriction on the right
                to deferred compensation of the president is not
                substantial, and such rights are not subject to a
                substantial risk of forfeiture.

(e) Performance-based compensation---

    (1) In general.

        The term performance-based compensation means compensation the
        amount of which, or the entitlement to which, is contingent
        on the satisfaction of preestablished organizational or
        individual performance criteria relating to a performance
        period of at least 12 consecutive months. Organizational or
        individual performance criteria are considered preestablished
        if established in writing by not later than 90 days after the
        commencement of the period of service to which the criteria
        relates, provided that the outcome is substantially uncertain
        at the time the criteria are established. Performance-based
        compensation may include payments based on performance
        criteria that are not approved by a compensation committee
        of the board of directors (or similar entity in the case of
        a non-corporate service recipient) or by the stockholders
        or members of the service recipient. Performance-based
        compensation does not include any amount or portion of any
        amount that will be paid either regardless of performance,
        or based upon a level of performance that is substantially
        certain to be met at the time the criteria is established. In
        addition, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this
        section, compensation is not performance-based compensation
        merely because the amount of such compensation is determined
        by reference to the value of the service recipient or
        the stock of the service recipient. Where a portion of an
        amount of compensation would qualify as performance-based
        compensation if the portion were the sole amount available
        under the plan, that portion of the award will not fail to
        qualify as performance-based compensation if that portion is
        designated separately or otherwise separately identifiable
        under the terms of the plan, and the amount of each portion
        is determined independently of the other. Compensation may
        be performance-based compensation where the amount will be
        paid regardless of satisfaction of the performance criteria
        due to the service provider's death, disability, or a change
        in control event (as defined in section 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i)),
        provided that a payment made under such circumstances without
        regard to the satisfaction of the performance criteria will
        not constitute performance-based compensation. For purposes of
        this paragraph (e)(1), a disability refers to any medically
        determinable physical or mental impairment resulting in
        the service provider's inability to perform the duties of
        his or her position or any substantially similar position,
        where such impairment can be expected to result in death or
        can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less
        than six months.

    (2) Payments based upon subjective performance criteria.

        The term performance-based compensation includes payments
        based upon subjective performance criteria, provided that---

        (i) The subjective performance criteria are bona fide and
            relate to the performance of the participant service
            provider, a group of service providers that includes
            the participant service provider, or a business unit for
            which the participant service provider provides services
            (which may include the entire organization); and

        (ii) The determination that any subjective performance criteria
            have been met is not made by the participant service
            provider or a family member of the participant service
            provider (as defined in section 267(c)(4) applied as if the
            family of an individual includes the spouse of any member
            of the family), or a person under the effective control of
            the participant service provider or such a family member,
            and no amount of the compensation of the person making
            such determination is effectively controlled in whole or
            in part by the service provider or such a family member.

    (3) Equity-based compensation.

        Compensation is performance-based compensation if it is
        based solely on an increase in the value of the service
        recipient, or a share of stock in the service recipient,
        after the date of a grant or award. However, compensation
        payable for a service period that is equal to the value of
        a predetermined number of shares of stock, and is variable
        only to the extent that the value of such shares appreciates
        or depreciates, generally will not be performance-based
        compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the attainment of
        a prescribed value for the service recipient (or a portion
        thereof), or a share of stock in the service recipient,
        may be used as a preestablished organizational criterion
        for purposes of providing performance-based compensation,
        provided that the other requirements of paragraph (e)(1)
        of this section are satisfied. In addition, an award of
        equity-based compensation may constitute performance-based
        compensation if entitlement to the compensation is subject to
        a condition that would cause the award to otherwise qualify
        as performance-based compensation, such as a performance-based
        vesting condition. A provision that allows a service provider
        to defer compensation that would be realized upon the exercise
        of a stock right generally constitutes an additional deferral
        feature for purposes of the definition of a deferral of
        compensation under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

(f) Service provider---

    (1) In general.

        The term service provider includes an individual, corporation,
        subchapter S corporation, partnership, personal service
        corporation (as defined in section 269A(b)(1)), noncorporate
        entity that would be a personal service corporation if it were
        a corporation, qualified personal service corporation (as
        defined in section 448(d)(2)), and noncorporate entity that
        would be a qualified personal service corporation if it were
        a corporation, for any taxable year in which such individual,
        corporation, subchapter S corporation, partnership, or other
        entity accounts for gross income from the performance of
        services under the cash receipts and disbursements method
        of accounting. The term service provider generally includes
        a person who has separated from service (a former service
        provider).

    (2) Independent contractors---

        (i) In general.

            Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of
            this section, section 409A does not apply to an amount
            deferred under a plan between a service provider and
            service recipient with respect to a particular trade or
            business in which the service provider participates,
            including earnings credited to such deferred amount,
            if during the service provider's taxable year in which
            the service provider obtains a legally binding right to
            the payment of the amount deferred each of the following
            applies:

            (A) The service provider is actively engaged in the
                trade or business of providing services, other than as
                an employee or as a member of the board of directors
                of a corporation (or similar position with respect
                to an entity that is not a corporation).

            (B) The service provider provides significant services
                to two or more service recipients to which the service
                provider is not related and that are not related
                to one another (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)
                of this section).

            (C) The service provider is not related to the service
                recipient, applying the definition of related person
                contained in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section
                subject to the modification that the language "20
                percent" is not used instead of "50 percent" each place
                "50 percent" appears in sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1).

        (ii) Related person.

            For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a person is related
            to another person if the persons bear a relationship
            to each other that is specified in section 267(b)
            or 707(b)(1), subject to the modifications that the
            language "20 percent" is used instead of "50 percent"
            each place it appears in sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1),
            and section 267(c)(4) is applied as if the family of an
            individual includes the spouse of any member of the family;
            or the persons are engaged in trades or businesses under
            common control (within the meaning of section 52(a) and
            (b)). In addition, an individual is related to an entity
            if the individual is an officer of an entity that is a
            corporation, or holds a position substantially similar
            to an officer of a corporation with an entity that is
            not a corporation.

        (iii) Significant services.

            Whether a service provider is providing significant
            services depends on the facts and circumstances of each
            case. However, for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this
            section, a service provider who provides services to two
            or more service recipients to which the service provider
            is not related and that are not related to one another
            is deemed to be providing significant services to two or
            more of such service recipients for a given taxable year,
            if the revenues generated from the services provided to any
            service recipient or group of related service recipients
            during such taxable year do not exceed 70 percent of the
            total revenue generated by the service provider from the
            trade or business of providing such services. In addition,
            in the case of a service provider who has been providing
            services in a trade or business for a period of not less
            than three consecutive years, for purposes of paragraph
            (f)(2)(i) of this section, a service provider who provides
            services to two or more service recipients to which the
            service provider is not related and that are not related to
            one another is deemed to be providing significant services
            to two or more of such service recipients for a given
            taxable year if in each of the prior three taxable years
            the revenues generated from the services provided to any
            service recipient or group of related service recipients
            during such prior taxable years did not exceed 70 percent
            of the total revenue generated by the service provider
            from the trade or business of providing such services
            and, at the time an amount is deferred, the service
            provider does not know or have reason to anticipate that
            the revenues generated from the services provided to any
            service recipient or group of related service recipients
            during the current year will exceed 70 percent of the
            total revenue generated by the service provider from the
            trade or business of providing such services.

        (iv) Management services.

            This paragraph (f)(2) does not apply to a service provider
            to the extent the service provider provides management
            services to a service recipient. For purposes of this
            paragraph (f)(2)(iv), the term management services means
            services that involve the actual or de facto direction
            or control of the financial or operational aspects of a
            trade or business of the service recipient, or investment
            management or advisory services provided to a service
            recipient whose primary trade or business includes the
            investment of financial assets (including investments
            in real estate), such as a hedge fund or a real estate
            investment trust.

        (v) Services provided to related persons.

            Section 409A does not apply to an amount deferred under
            a plan that is a bona fide agreement, method, program,
            or other arrangement between a service provider and a
            related service recipient arising in the ordinary course
            of a particular trade or business in which the service
            provider is engaged to the extent that---

            (A) The service provider provides services to the service
                recipient as an independent contractor;

            (B) During the service provider's taxable year in which
                the amount is deferred, the service provider qualifies
                for the safe harbor provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii)
                of this section with respect to such trade or
                business; and

            (C) Such agreement, method, program, or other arrangement
                and the practices thereunder (including billing and
                collection practices), are substantially similar
                to the agreements, methods, programs, or other
                arrangements and practices applicable to one or more
                unrelated service recipients to whom the service
                provider provides substantial services and that
                produce a majority of the total revenue that the
                service provider earns from the trade or business of
                providing such services during the taxable year.

(g) Service recipient.

    Except as otherwise specifically provided in these regulations,
    the term service recipient means the person for whom the services
    are performed and with respect to whom the legally binding right
    to compensation arises, and all persons with whom such person would
    be considered a single employer under section 414(b) (employees of
    controlled group of corporations), and all persons with whom such
    person would be considered a single employer under section 414(c)
    (employees of partnerships, proprietorships, etc., under common
    control). For example, if the service provider is an employee,
    the service recipient generally is the employer (including all
    persons treated as a single employer under section 414(b) or
    (c)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, section 409A applies to a
    plan that provides for the deferral of compensation, even if the
    payment of the compensation is not made by the person for whom
    services are performed.

(h) Separation from service---

    (1) Employees---

        (i) In general.

            An employee separates from service with the employer if
            the employee dies, retires, or otherwise has a termination
            of employment with the employer. However, for purposes
            of this paragraph (h)(1), the employment relationship is
            treated as continuing intact while the individual is on
            military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of
            absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six
            months, or if longer, so long as the individual retains
            a right to reemployment with the service recipient under
            an applicable statute or by contract. For purposes of
            this paragraph (h)(1), a leave of absence constitutes a
            bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable
            expectation that the employee will return to perform
            services for the employer. If the period of leave exceeds
            six months and the individual does not retain a right to
            reemployment under an applicable statute or by contract,
            the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on
            the first date immediately following such six-month
            period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of
            absence is due to any medically determinable physical
            or mental impairment that can be expected to result in
            death or can be expected to last for a continuous period
            of not less than six months, where such impairment causes
            the employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or
            her position of employment or any substantially similar
            position of employment, a 29-month period of absence may
            be substituted for such six-month period.

        (ii) Termination of employment.

            Whether a termination of employment has occurred is
            determined based on whether the facts and circumstances
            indicate that the employer and employee reasonably
            anticipated that no further services would be performed
            after a certain date or that the level of bona fide
            services the employee would perform after such date
            (whether as an employee or as an independent contractor)
            would permanently decrease to no more than 20 percent
            of the average level of bona fide services performed
            (whether as an employee or an independent contractor)
            over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the
            full period of services to the employer if the employee
            has been providing services to the employer less than
            36 months). Facts and circumstances to be considered in
            making this determination include, but are not limited to,
            whether the employee continues to be treated as an employee
            for other purposes (such as continuation of salary and
            participation in employee benefit programs), whether
            similarly situated service providers have been treated
            consistently, and whether the employee is permitted,
            and realistically available, to perform services for
            other service recipients in the same line of business. An
            employee is presumed to have separated from service where
            the level of bona fide services performed decreases to a
            level equal to 20 percent or less of the average level of
            services performed by the employee during the immediately
            preceding 36-month period. An employee will be presumed
            not to have separated from service where the level of
            bona fide services performed continues at a level that
            is 50 percent or more of the average level of service
            performed by the employee during the immediately preceding
            36-month period. No presumption applies to a decrease in
            the level of bona fide services performed to a level that
            is more than 20 percent and less than 50 percent of the
            average level of bona fide services performed during the
            immediately preceding 36-month period. The presumption
            is rebuttable by demonstrating that the employer and the
            employee reasonably anticipated that as of a certain
            date the level of bona fide services would be reduced
            permanently to a level less than or equal to 20 percent of
            the average level of bona fide services provided during
            the immediately preceding 36-month period or full period
            of services provided to the employer if the employee has
            been providing services to the service recipient for a
            period of less than 36 months (or that the level of bona
            fide services would not be so reduced). For example, an
            employee may demonstrate that the employer and employee
            reasonably anticipated that the employee would cease
            providing services, but that, after the original cessation
            of services, business circumstances such as termination of
            the employee's replacement caused the employee to return to
            employment. Although the employee's return to employment
            may cause the employee to be presumed to have continued
            in employment because the employee is providing services
            at a rate equal to the rate at which the employee was
            providing services before the termination of employment,
            the facts and circumstances in this case would demonstrate
            that at the time the employee originally ceased to provide
            services, the employee and the service recipient reasonably
            anticipated that the employee would not provide services
            in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
            of this paragraph (h)(1)(ii), a plan may treat another
            level of reasonably anticipated permanent reduction in
            the level of bona fide services as a separation from
            service, provided that the level of reduction required
            must be designated in writing as a specific percentage,
            and the reasonably anticipated reduced level of bona fide
            services must be greater than 20 percent but less that
            50 percent of the average level of bona fide services
            provided in the immediately preceding 36 months. The plan
            must specify the definition of separation from service on
            or before the date on which a separation from service is
            designated as a time of payment of the applicable amount
            deferred, and once designated, any change to the definition
            of separation from service with respect to such amount
            deferred will be subject to the rules regarding subsequent
            deferrals and the acceleration of payments. For purposes
            of this paragraph (h)(1)(ii), for periods during which
            an employee is on a paid bona fide leave of absence
            (as defined in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section)
            and has not otherwise terminated employment pursuant
            to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the employee is
            treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal
            to the level of services that the employee would have been
            required to perform to receive the compensation paid with
            respect to such leave of absence. Periods during which an
            employee is on an unpaid bona fide leave of absence (as
            defined in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section) and has
            not otherwise terminated employment pursuant to paragraph
            (h)(1)(i) of this section, are disregarded for purposes
            of this paragraph (h)(1)(ii) (including for purposes of
            determining the applicable 36-month (or shorter) period).

    (2) Independent contractors---

        (i) In general.

            An independent contractor is considered to have a
            separation from service with the service recipient upon
            the expiration of the contract (or in the case of more
            than one contract, all contracts) under which services
            are performed for the service recipient if the expiration
            constitutes a good-faith and complete termination of
            the contractual relationship. An expiration does not
            constitute a good faith and complete termination of
            the contractual relationship if the service recipient
            anticipates a renewal of a contractual relationship or
            the independent contractor becoming an employee. For this
            purpose, a service recipient is considered to anticipate
            the renewal of the contractual relationship with an
            independent contractor if it intends to contract again
            for the services provided under the expired contract,
            and neither the service recipient nor the independent
            contractor has eliminated the independent contractor
            as a possible provider of services under any such new
            contract. Further, a service recipient is considered to
            intend to contract again for the services provided under
            an expired contract if the service recipient's doing so is
            conditioned only upon incurring a need for the services,
            the availability of funds, or both.

        (ii) Special rule.

            Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, a
            plan is considered to satisfy the requirement described in
            section 1.409A-3(a)(1) with respect to an amount payable
            upon a separation from service if, with respect to amounts
            payable to a service provider who is an independent
            contractor, the plan provides that---

            (A) No amount will be paid to the service provider before a
                date at least 12 months after the day on which the
                contract expires under which the service provider
                performs services for the service recipient (or,
                in the case of more than one contract, all such
                contracts expire); and

            (B) No amount payable to the service provider on that
                date will be paid to the service provider if,
                after the expiration of the contract (or contracts)
                and before that date, the service provider performs
                services for the service recipient as an independent
                contractor or an employee.

    (3) Definition of service recipient and employer.

        For purposes of this paragraph (h), the term service
        recipient or employer means the service recipient as defined
        in paragraph (g) of this section, provided that in applying
        section 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) for purposes of determining
        a controlled group of corporations under section 414(b), the
        language "at least 50 percent" is used instead of "at least
        80 percent" each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1), (2),
        and (3), and in applying section 1.414(c)-2 for purposes of
        determining trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated)
        that are under common control for purposes of section 414(c),
        "at least 50 percent" is used instead of "at least 80 percent"
        each place it appears in section 1.414(c)-2. A plan may
        provide with respect to a deferral of compensation under the
        plan that in applying sections 1563(a)(1), (2), and (3) for
        purposes of determining a controlled group of corporations
        under section 414(b), another defined percentage greater than
        50 percent, but not greater than 80 percent, is used instead
        of "at least 80 percent" at each place it appears in sections
        1563(a)(1), (2), and (3), and in applying section 1.414(c)-2
        for purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or
        not incorporated) that are under common control for purposes
        of section 414(c), another defined percentage greater than 50
        percent, but not greater than 80 percent, is used instead of
        "at least 80 percent" at each place it appears in section
        1.414(c)-2. In addition, where the use of such definition of
        service recipient for purposes of determining a separation from
        service is based upon legitimate business criteria, the plan
        may provide that for purposes of a deferral of compensation
        under the plan that in applying sections 1563(a)(1), (2),
        and (3) for purposes of determining a controlled group of
        corporations under section 414(b), the language "at least
        20 percent" or another defined percentage not less than 20
        percent but not greater than 50 percent is used instead of
        "at least 80 percent" at each place it appears in sections
        1563(a)(1), (2), and (3), and in applying section 1.414(c)-2
        for purposes of determining trades or businesses (whether or
        not incorporated) that are under common control for purposes of
        section 414(c), the language "at least 20 percent" or another
        defined percentage not less than 20 percent but not greater
        than 50 percent is used instead of "at least 80 percent"
        at each place it appears in section 1.414(c)-2. Where a
        definition of service recipient or employer other than the
        definition provided in the first sentence of this paragraph
        (h)(3) (the 50 percent standard) is used, the plan must
        designate in writing the alternate definition no later than
        the last date at which the time and form of payment of the
        applicable amount deferred must be elected in accordance with
        section 1.409A-2(a), and any change in the definition for such
        amounts deferred will constitute a change in the time and form
        of payment subject to the rules governing subsequent deferral
        elections under section 1.409A-2(b) and the acceleration of
        payments under section 1.409A-3(j).

    (4) Asset purchase transactions.

        Where as part of a sale or other disposition of assets by one
        service recipient (seller) to an unrelated service recipient
        (buyer), a service provider of the seller would otherwise
        experience a separation from service with the seller, the
        seller and the buyer may retain the discretion to specify,
        and may specify, whether a service provider providing
        services to the seller immediately before the asset purchase
        transaction and providing services to the buyer after and in
        connection with the asset purchase transaction has experienced
        a separation from service for purposes of this paragraph (h),
        provided that the asset purchase transaction results from
        bona fide, arm's length negotiations, all service providers
        providing services to the seller immediately before the asset
        purchase transaction and providing services to the buyer after
        and in connection with the asset purchase transaction are
        treated consistently (regardless of position at the seller)
        for purposes of applying the provisions of any nonqualified
        deferred compensation plan, and such treatment is specified in
        writing no later than the closing date of the asset purchase
        transaction. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(4), references
        to a sale or other disposition of assets, or an asset purchase
        transaction, refer only to a transfer of substantial assets,
        such as a plant or division or substantially all the assets of
        a trade or business. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(4),
        whether a service recipient is related to another service
        recipient is determined under the rules provided in paragraph
        (f)(2)(ii) of this section.

    (5) Dual status.

        If a service provider provides services both as an employee
        of a service recipient and as an independent contractor of
        a service recipient, the service provider must separate
        from service both as an employee and as an independent
        contractor to be treated as having separated from service. If
        a service provider ceases providing services as an independent
        contractor and begins providing services as an employee, or
        ceases providing services as an employee and begins providing
        services as an independent contractor, the service provider
        will not be considered to have a separation from service
        until the service provider has ceased providing services in
        both capacities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a service
        provider provides services both as an employee of a service
        recipient and a member of the board of directors of a corporate
        service recipient (or an analogous position with respect to a
        non-corporate service recipient), the services provided as a
        director are not taken into account in determining whether the
        service provider has a separation from service as an employee
        for purposes of a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in
        which the service provider participates as an employee that
        is not aggregated with any plan in which the service provider
        participates as a director under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this
        section. In addition, if a service provider provides services
        both as an employee of a service recipient and a member of
        the board of directors of a corporate service recipient (or
        an analogous position with respect to a non-corporate service
        recipient), the services provided as an employee are not taken
        into account in determining whether the service provider has
        a separation from service as a director for purposes of a
        nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which the service
        provider participates as a director that is not aggregated
        with any plan in which the service provider participates as
        an employee under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

    (6) Collectively bargained plans covering multiple
        employers.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (h),
        to the extent a plan is established pursuant to a bona fide
        collective bargaining agreement covering services performed
        by employees for multiple employers, such plan may define a
        separation from service in a reasonable manner that treats
        the employee as not having separated from service during
        periods in which the employee is not providing services but
        is available to perform services covered by the collective
        bargaining agreement for one or more employers, provided
        that the definition also provides that the employee must
        be deemed to have separated from service at a specified
        date not later than the end of any period of at least 12
        consecutive months during which the employee has not provided
        any services covered by the collective bargaining agreement
        to any participating employer. This paragraph (h)(6) applies
        only if the definition of separation from service provided by
        the collective bargaining agreement was the subject of arm's
        length negotiations between employee representatives and two or
        more employers, the agreement between employee representatives
        and such employers satisfies section 7701(a)(46), and the
        circumstances surrounding the agreement evidence good faith
        bargaining between adverse parties over such definition.

(i) Specified employee---

    (1) In general.

        The term specified employee means a service provider who,
        as of the date of the service provider's separation from
        service, is a key employee of a service recipient any stock
        of which is publicly traded on an established securities
        market or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(1),
        a service provider is a key employee if the service provider
        meets the requirements of section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii), or
        (iii) (applied in accordance with the regulations thereunder
        and disregarding section 416(i)(5)) at any time during the
        12-month period ending on a specified employee identification
        date. If a service provider is a key employee as of a specified
        employee identification date, the service provider is treated
        as a key employee for purposes of this paragraph (i) for the
        entire 12-month period beginning on the specified employee
        effective date.

    (2) Definition of compensation.

        For purposes of identifying a specified employee by applying
        the requirements of section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii), and (iii),
        the definition of compensation under section 1.415(c)-2(a) is
        used, applied as if the service recipient were not using any
        safe harbor provided in section 1.415(c)-2(d), were not using
        any of the elective special timing rules provided in section
        1.415(c)-2(e), and were not using any of the elective special
        rules provided in section 1.415(c)-2(g). Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, a service recipient may elect to use any
        available definition of compensation under section 415 and
        the regulations thereunder in accordance with the election
        requirements set forth in paragraph (i)(8) of this section,
        including any available safe harbor and any available election
        under the timing rules or special rules, provided that the
        definition is applied consistently to all employees of the
        service recipient for purposes of identifying specified
        employees. A service recipient may elect to use such
        an alternative definition regardless of whether another
        definition of compensation is being used for purposes of a
        qualified plan sponsored by the service recipient. However,
        once a list of specified employees has become effective, the
        service recipient cannot change the definition of compensation
        for purposes of identifying specified employees for the period
        with respect to which such list is effective.

    (3) Specified employee identification date.

        Unless another date is designated in accordance with the
        requirements of this paragraph (i)(3) and paragraph (i)(8)
        of this section, the specified employee identification date is
        December 31. A service recipient may designate in accordance
        with the requirements of paragraph (i)(8) of this section
        any other date as the specified employee identification date,
        provided that a service recipient must use the same specified
        employee identification date with respect to all nonqualified
        deferred compensation plans, and any change to the specified
        employee identification date may not be effective for a period
        of at least 12 months. The service recipient may designate a
        specified employee identification date in each plan or in a
        separate document applicable to all plans, provided that the
        service recipient will not be treated as having designated a
        specified employee identification date before the designation
        is legally binding on the service recipient and all affected
        service providers. Any designation of a specified employee
        identification date made on or before December 31, 2007,
        may be applied to any separation from service occurring on or
        after January 1, 2005, unless and until subsequently changed
        pursuant to this paragraph (i)(3).

    (4) Specified employee effective date.

        Unless another date is designated in accordance with the
        requirements of this paragraph (i)(4) and paragraph (i)(8)
        of this section, the specified employee effective date is the
        first day of the fourth month following the specified employee
        identification date. A service recipient may designate
        in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i)(8)
        of this section any date following the specified employee
        identification date as the specified employee effective date,
        provided that such date may not be later than the first
        day of the fourth month following the specified employee
        identification date, and provided further that a service
        recipient must use the same specified employee effective
        date with respect to all nonqualified deferred compensation
        plans, and any change to the specified employee effective date
        may not be effective for a period of at least 12 months. The
        service recipient may designate a specified employee effective
        date through inclusion in each plan document or through a
        separate document applicable to all plans, provided that the
        service recipient will not be treated as having designated
        a specified employee effective date on any date before the
        designation is legally binding on the service recipient and
        all affected service providers. Any designation of a specified
        employee effective date made on or before December 31, 2007,
        may be applied to any separation from service occurring on or
        after January 1, 2005, unless and until subsequently changed
        pursuant to this paragraph (i)(4).

    (5) Alternative methods of satisfying the six-month delay rule.

        A plan may provide, in accordance with the requirements of
        paragraph (i)(8) of this section, for an alternative method
        to identify service providers who will be subject to the
        six-month delay rule provided in section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i),
        provided that the alternative method is reasonably designed to
        include all specified employees (determined without respect to
        any available service recipient elections), the alternative
        method is an objectively determinable standard providing no
        direct or indirect election to any service provider regarding
        its application, and the alternative method results in either
        all service providers or no more than 200 service providers
        being identified in the class as of any date. Use of such
        an alternative method will not be treated as a change in the
        time and form of payment for purposes of section 1.409A-2(b)
        (the subsequent deferral rules), even if the service provider
        is not a specified employee when the payment is delayed.

    (6) Corporate transactions---

      (i) Mergers and acquisitions of public service recipients.

          If as a result of a corporate transaction, two or more
          separate service recipients, more than one of which has
          stock outstanding that is publicly traded on an established
          securities market or otherwise immediately before the
          transaction, become one service recipient, any stock of
          which is publicly traded on an established securities market
          or otherwise immediately after the transaction (resulting
          public service recipient), the resulting public service
          recipient's next specified employee identification date and
          specified employee effective date following the corporate
          transaction are the specified employee identification date
          and specified employee effective date that the acquiring
          service recipient would have been required to use absent such
          transaction. For this purpose, in the case of a corporate
          merger, the acquiring service recipient is the service
          recipient that included the surviving corporation in such
          merger, in the case of an acquisition by a corporation of the
          stock of another corporation, the acquiring service recipient
          is the service recipient that included the corporation that
          acquired such stock, and in all other cases, the surviving
          service recipient is determined on the basis of all of
          the facts and circumstances. For the period between the
          transaction and the next specified employee effective date,
          the list of specified employees of the resulting public
          service recipient is determined by combining the lists of
          specified employees of all service recipients participating
          in the transaction that were in effect at the date of the
          corporate transaction, ranking such specified employees
          in order of the amount of compensation used to determine
          each specified employee's status as a specified employee,
          and treating the top 50 of such specified employees, plus
          any employees described in section 416(i)(1)(ii) or section
          416(i)(1)(iii) and the regulations thereunder (relating to
          1-percent and 5-percent owners) who are not included in
          such top 50 specified employees, as specified employees
          for the period between the corporate transaction and the
          next specified employee effective date. Alternatively, the
          resulting service recipient may elect in accordance with
          the requirements of paragraph (i)(8) of this section to use
          any reasonable method to determine the specified employees
          of the resulting service recipient, including the use of
          an alternative method of compliance described in paragraph
          (i)(5) of this section, provided that such method is adopted
          no later than 90 days after the corporate transaction and
          applied prospectively from the date the method is adopted.

      (ii) Mergers and acquisitions of nonpublic service recipients.

          If as part of a corporate transaction a service recipient
          that does not have outstanding stock that is publicly traded
          on an established securities market or otherwise immediately
          before the transaction (initial private service recipient),
          and a service recipient with stock outstanding that is
          publicly traded on an established securities market or
          otherwise immediately before the transaction (initial public
          service recipient), become a single service recipient having
          stock that is publicly traded on an established securities
          market or otherwise immediately after the transaction
          (resulting public service recipient), the resulting public
          service recipient's next specified employee identification
          date and specified employee effective date following
          the corporate transaction are the specified employee
          identification date and specified employee effective date
          that the initial public service recipient would have been
          required to use absent such transaction. For the period after
          the date of the corporate transaction and before the next
          specified employee effective date, the specified employees
          of the initial public service recipient immediately before
          the transaction continue to be the specified employees of
          the resulting public service recipient, and no service
          providers of the initial private service recipient are
          required to be treated as specified employees.

      (iii) Spinoffs.

          If as part of a corporate transaction, a service recipient
          with stock outstanding that is publicly traded on an
          established securities market or otherwise immediately
          before the transaction (initial public service recipient),
          becomes two or more separate service recipients, each with
          stock outstanding that is publicly traded on an established
          securities market or otherwise immediately after the
          transaction (post-transaction public service recipients),
          the next specified employee identification date of each
          of the post-transaction public service recipients is the
          specified employee identification date that the initial
          public service recipient would have been required to use
          absent such transaction. For the period after the date of
          the corporate transaction and before the next specified
          employee effective date, the specified employees of the
          initial public service recipient immediately before the
          transaction continue to be the specified employees of the
          post-transaction public service recipients.

      (iv) Public offerings and other corporate transactions.

          If as part of an initial public offering or corporate
          transaction not described in paragraph (i)(6)(ii) or (iii)
          of this section, a service recipient with no outstanding
          stock that is publicly traded on an established securities
          market or otherwise immediately before such offering or other
          transaction (initial private service recipient), becomes
          one or more service recipients with stock outstanding that
          is publicly traded on an established securities market
          or otherwise immediately after such offering or other
          transaction (post-transaction public service recipient), each
          post-transaction public service recipient has a specified
          employee identification date of December 31 and a specified
          employee effective date of April 1, effective retroactively
          to the December 31 and April 1 next preceding the offering or
          other transaction for purposes of identifying the specified
          employees between the corporation transaction and the next
          December 31. Alternatively, a post-transaction public service
          recipient may elect in accordance with the requirements
          of paragraph (i)(8) of this section, a specified employee
          identification date and specified employee effective date on
          or before the date of the offering or other transaction. If
          a public service recipient makes such an election, for the
          period after the offering or other transaction and before
          the next specified employee effective date, the specified
          employees of the post-transaction public service recipient
          consist of the service providers that at the time of the
          offering or other transaction would have been classified as
          specified employees of the initial private service recipient,
          had the initial private service recipient elected the same
          specified employee identification date and specified employee
          effective date as selected by the post-transaction public
          service recipient, and had such initial private service
          recipient had stock publicly traded on an established
          securities market or otherwise as of the specified employee
          identification date preceding the transaction.

      (v) Alternative methods of compliance.

          For purposes of this paragraph (i)(6), references
          to specified employees as of a corporate transaction or
          offering include any specified employees identified through
          the use of an alternative method described in paragraph
          (i)(5) of this section, where the use of such alternative
          method was established and effective at the time of the
          corporate transaction or offering.

    (7) Nonresident alien employees.

        For purposes of determining whether an employee meets the
        requirements of section 416(i)(1)(A)(i), (ii), or (iii)
        (applied in accordance with the regulations thereunder
        and disregarding section 416(i)(5)), and therefore is a
        key employee, the incorporation of the rules of section
        1.415(c)-2(g)(5) regarding the definition of compensation
        applies. Accordingly, the rule of section 1.415(c)-2(g)(5)(i),
        generally requiring the treatment as compensation of certain
        compensation excludible from an employee's gross income
        due to the location of the services or the identity of the
        employer, applies. In addition, a service recipient may
        elect in accordance with paragraph (i)(8) of this section to
        apply the rule of section 1.415(c)-2(g)(5)(ii) to not treat as
        compensation certain compensation excludible from an employee's
        gross income on account of the location of the services or the
        identity of the employer that is not effectively connected
        with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
        States. A service recipient may elect to apply the rule of
        section 1.415-2(g)(5)(ii) regardless of whether the service
        recipient has elected to apply the rule to a qualified plan
        sponsored by the service recipient; however, once a list of
        specified employees has become effective, any election of the
        rule for that period may not be changed. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, any election of the rule made before January 1,
        2008, may be effective with respect to any specified employee
        identification date on or before December 31, 2007.

    (8) Elections affecting the identification of specified
        employees.

        The elections described in paragraphs (i)(2) through (7)
        of this section are effective only as of the date that
        all necessary corporate action has been taken to make such
        elections binding for purposes of all affected nonqualified
        deferred compensation plans in which the service providers of
        the service recipient that would become a specified employee
        due to the application of such election participate. Where
        a taxpayer attempts to make an election under paragraph
        (i)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this section but such
        election is not binding on all the affected nonqualified
        deferred compensation plans and applied consistently to all
        such service providers, the election is not effective and
        the rule under paragraph (i)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7)
        of this section, as applicable, that would apply absent an
        election is applicable for identifying specified employees.

(j) Nonresident alien.

    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section,
        the term nonresident alien means an individual who is---

        (i) A nonresident alien within the meaning of section
            7701(b)(1)(B); or

        (ii) A dual resident taxpayer within the meaning of
            section 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this chapter with respect
            to any taxable year in which such individual is treated
            as a nonresident alien for purposes of computing the
            individual's U.S. income tax liability.

    (2) The term nonresident alien does not include---

        (i) A nonresident alien with respect to whom an election is
            in effect for the taxable year under section 6013(g)
            to be treated as a resident of the United States;

        (ii) A former citizen or long-term resident (within the meaning
            of section 877(e)(2)) who expatriated after June 3, 2004,
            and has not complied with the requirements of section
            7701(n); or

        (iii) An individual who is treated as a citizen or resident
            of the United States for the taxable year under section
            877(g).

(k) Established securities market.

    The term established securities market means an established
    securities market within the meaning of section 1.897-1(m).

(l) Stock right.

    The term stock right means a stock option (other than an incentive
    stock option described in section 422 or an option granted pursuant
    to an employee stock purchase plan described in section 423)
    or a stock appreciation right.

(m) Separation pay plan.

    The term separation pay plan means any plan that provides
    separation pay or, where a plan provides both amounts that are
    separation pay and that are not separation pay, that portion of
    the plan that provides separation pay. The term separation pay
    means any deferral of compensation (before the application of
    the exclusions from the definition of a deferral of compensation
    set forth in paragraph (b)(9) of this section) that will not be
    paid under any circumstances unless the service provider has had
    a separation from service, whether voluntary or involuntary,
    including payments in the form of reimbursements of expenses
    incurred, and the provision of in-kind benefits. A deferral of
    compensation that the service provider may receive without a
    separation from service does not become separation pay merely
    because the service provider elects to receive or receives the
    payment after or upon a separation from service. A deferral of
    compensation does not fail to be separation pay merely because
    the payment is conditioned upon the execution of a release of
    claims, noncompetition or nondisclosure provisions, or other
    similar requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount,
    or entitlement to any amount, that acts as a substitute for,
    or replacement of, amounts deferred by the service recipient
    under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan constitutes a
    payment of compensation or deferral of compensation under such
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

(n) Involuntary separation from service---

    (1) In general.

        An involuntary separation from service means a separation from
        service due to the independent exercise of the unilateral
        authority of the service recipient to terminate the service
        provider's services, other than due to the service provider's
        implicit or explicit request, where the service provider
        was willing and able to continue performing services. An
        involuntary separation from service may include the service
        recipient's failure to renew a contract at the time such
        contract expires, provided that the service provider was
        willing and able to execute a new contract providing terms and
        conditions substantially similar to those in the expiring
        contract and to continue providing such services. The
        determination of whether a separation from service is
        involuntary is based on all the facts and circumstances. Any
        characterization of the separation from service as voluntary or
        involuntary by the service provider and the service recipient
        in the documentation of the separation from service is presumed
        to properly characterize the nature of the separation from
        service. However, the presumption may be rebutted where the
        facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. For example,
        if a separation from service is designated as a voluntary
        separation from service or resignation, but the facts and
        circumstances indicate that absent such voluntary separation
        from service the service recipient would have terminated the
        service provider's services, and that the service provider had
        knowledge that the service provider would be so terminated,
        the separation from service is involuntary.

    (2) Separations from service for good reason---

        (i) In general.

            Notwithstanding paragraph (n)(1) of this section, a
            service provider's voluntary separation from service
            will be treated for purposes of this section and
            sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6 as an involuntary
            separation from service if the separation from service
            occurs under certain limited bona fide conditions, where
            the avoidance of the requirements of section 409A is
            not a purpose of the inclusion of these conditions in
            the plan or of the actions by the service recipient in
            connection with the satisfaction of these conditions,
            and a voluntary separation from service under such
            conditions effectively constitutes an involuntary
            separation from service. Generally such conditions will be
            prespecified under an agreement to provide compensation
            upon a separation from service for good reason. Such a
            good reason (or a similar condition) must be defined to
            require actions taken by the service recipient resulting
            in a material negative change to the service provider
            in the service relationship, such as the duties to be
            performed, the conditions under which such duties are
            to be performed, or the compensation to be received
            for performing such services. Other factors taken into
            account in determining whether a separation from service
            for good reason effectively constitutes an involuntary
            separation from service include the extent to which the
            payments upon a separation from service for good reason
            are in the same amount and are to be made at the same
            time and in the same form as payments available upon an
            actual involuntary separation from service, and whether the
            service provider is required to give the service recipient
            notice of the existence of the condition that would result
            in treatment as a separation from service for good reason
            and a reasonable opportunity to remedy the condition.

        (ii) Safe harbor.

            For purposes of this section and sections 1.409A-2 through
            1.409A-6, if a plan provides that a voluntary separation
            from service will be treated as an involuntary separation
            from service if the separation from service occurs under
            certain express conditions, a separation from service
            satisfying the conditions set forth in the plan will be
            treated as an involuntary separation from the service if
            the necessary conditions (or set of conditions) require
            the following:

            (A) The separation from service must occur during a
                pre-determined limited period of time not to exceed
                two years following the initial existence of one or
                more of the following conditions arising without the
                consent of the service provider:

                (1) A material diminution in the service provider's
                    base compensation.

                (2) A material diminution in the service provider's
                    authority, duties, or responsibilities.

                (3) A material diminution in the authority, duties,
                    or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom
                    the service provider is required to report,
                    including a requirement that a service provider
                    report to a corporate officer or employee instead
                    of reporting directly to the board of directors
                    of a corporation (or similar governing body with
                    respect to an entity other than a corporation).

                (4) A material diminution in the budget over which
                    the service provider retains authority.

                (5) A material change in the geographic location at
                    which the service provider must perform the
                    services.

                (6) Any other action or inaction that constitutes
                    a material breach by the service recipient of
                    the agreement under which the service provider
                    provides services.

            (B) The amount, time, and form of payment upon the
                separation from service must be substantially identical
                to the amount, time and form of payment payable due
                to an actual involuntary separation from service,
                to the extent such a right exists.

            (C) The service provider must be required to provide
                notice to the service recipient of the existence of
                the condition described in paragraph (n)(2)(ii)(A)
                of this section within a period not to exceed 90 days
                of the initial existence of the condition, upon the
                notice of which the service recipient must be provided
                a period of at least 30 days during which it may remedy
                the condition and not be required to pay the amount.

    (3) Special rule for certain collectively bargained
        plans.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this paragraph
        (n), to the extent a plan is subject to a bona fide collective
        bargaining agreement covering services performed for multiple
        employers under which an employee must separate from service
        with all such employers in order to receive a payment,
        such plan may use any reasonable definition of involuntary
        separation from service, provided that such definition is
        consistent with any definition of a separation from service
        adopted under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, and provided
        further that the definition of an involuntary separation from
        service provided by the collective bargaining agreement was
        the subject of arm's length negotiations between employee
        representatives and two or more employers, the agreement
        between employee representatives and such employers satisfies
        section 7701(a)(46), and the circumstances surrounding the
        agreement evidence good faith bargaining between adverse
        parties over such definition.

(o) Earnings.

    Whether a deferred amount constitutes earnings on an amount
    deferred, or actual or notional income attributable to an
    amount deferred, is determined under the principles defining
    income attributable to the amount taken into account under
    section 31.3121(v)(2)-1(d)(2) of this chapter. Accordingly,
    with respect to an account balance plan, earnings on an amount
    deferred generally include an amount credited on behalf of a
    service provider under the terms of the plan that reflects a
    rate of return that does not exceed either the rate of return
    on a predetermined actual investment or, if the income does not
    reflect the rate of return on a predetermined actual investment,
    a reasonable rate of interest. With respect to nonaccount
    balance plans, earnings on an amount deferred generally include
    an increase, due solely to the passage of time, in the present
    value of the future payments to which the service provider has
    obtained a legally binding right, the present value of which
    constituted the amount deferred (determined as of the date
    such amount was deferred), but only if the amount deferred was
    determined using reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods. A
    right to earnings on an amount deferred generally is treated
    as a right to a deferral of compensation for purposes of this
    section and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6. However, for
    purposes of any provision of this section and sections 1.409A-2
    through 1.409A-6 referring to earnings on deferred compensation
    (or similar terms), the use of an unreasonable rate of return,
    or unreasonable actuarial assumptions and methods, generally
    will result in the treatment of some or all of such a right to
    deferred compensation as a right only to deferred compensation,
    and not a right to earnings on deferred compensation, so that
    the provision will not be applicable. With respect to plans that
    are neither account balance plans nor nonaccount balance plans,
    these rules apply by analogy.

(p) In-kind benefits.

    The term in-kind benefits refers to services provided to or on
    behalf of a service provider, such as financial planning services,
    or tangible personal or real property made available for use
    by or on behalf of the service provider, such as the use of an
    aircraft or vehicle, and does not refer to a transfer of property
    within the meaning of section 83 and the regulations thereunder,
    or a promise to transfer, or an option to purchase or receive,
    property in the future.

(q) Application of definitions and rules.

    The definitions and rules set forth in paragraphs (a) through (p)
    of this section apply for purposes of section 409A, this section,
    and sections 1.409A-2 through 1.409A-6.
