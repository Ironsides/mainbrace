This is a plan for ""Company"", [Company Name], to give ""Awards"" of <Company> stock and options to buy <Company> stock.

    \ Purposes \ This plan has three main purposes:

        \\
        This plan makes it possible to give <Awards> without breaking securities laws. 
        In general, securities laws require companies to register their stock before giving it out. 
        Registering takes a lot of time and money. 
        Fortunately, exceptions, called "exemptions", allow companies to give out their stock without doing the whole registration process. 
        This plan is designed to follow exemptions that cover awards to employees and consultants under written stock plans that follow specific rules.

        \\
        This plan helps some <Awards> qualify for good tax treatment. 
        For example, some <Awards> of options can qualify for special treatment as "Incentive Stock Options" under the Internal Revenue Code. 
        This plan cannot guarantee good tax treatment or tell people who get <Awards> what personal tax choices to make. 
        But it can help <Awards> qualify for special treatment that people who get <Awards> might want.

        \\
        This plan helps organize the process of giving <Awards> over time. 
        It sets up a program for approving standard documents and making awards, and includes common rules that apply to all <Awards>.

    \ Contents \
    This plan sets out rules for its administration and for <Awards> generally. 
    It also gives some words and phrases specific definitions that apply throughout this plan and <Awards> documents.

    \ Stock Pool \

        \ Shares in the Pool \
        Under this plan, the <Administrator> may issue up to [Pool Shares] shares of the <Company>'s common stock under <Awards>. 
        This number is called the ""Pool"", and its starting size is called the ""Starting Size of the Pool"". 
        The <Administrator> may issue the whole <Pool> under <Incentive Stock Options> if it chooses.

        # Consider "recycle"
        \ Returning Shares to the Pool \
        Some stock under <Awards> can return to the <Pool>, to be recycled under new <Awards>.

            \\ When an <Award> expires before all the <Company> issues all the stock under it, the stock the <Company> has not issued returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When an <Award> can no longer be exercised, any stock under the <Award> that the <Company> has not issued returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When an <Option> is traded in under an <Option Exchange Program>, the stock under the <Option> returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When the <Company> holds back shares under an <Award> to cover part of the <Recipient>'s purchase price or withholding tax, the stock the <Company> holds back returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When <Restricted Shares> are forfeited to the <Company>, those shares return to the <Pool>.

            \\ When the <Company> uses a <Repurchase Right> to buy back <Restricted Shares>, those shares return to the <Pool>.

        Stock stops returning to the <Pool> when this plan terminates.

        \ Adjusting the Size of the Pool \
        The number of shares in the <Pool> can be adjusted under {Adjustments}. 
        However, the <Administrator> cannot issue more than the <Starting Size of the Pool> under <Incentive Stock Options> unless the <Section of the Tax Code on ISOs> allows the <Administrator> to recycle more shares.

    \ Administration \

        \ Who Administers this Plan? \
        The board of directors of the <Company>, the ""Board"", decides who administers this plan. 
        The <Board> may decide that:

            \\
            The <Board> administers this plan.

            \\
            A <Board> committee administers this plan.

            \\
            The <Board> and a <Board> committee administer this plan.

        A <Company> officer or group of <Company> officers may make <Awards> within limits set by the <Board>, if the law allows. 
        But the <Board> may not allow <Company> officers to make <Awards> to those covered by section 16 of the <Exchange Act> (Directors, Officers, and Principal Stockholders).

        \ Changing Who Administers the Plan \
        The <Board> may change who administers this plan over time. 
        If the <Board> uses a <Board> committee to administer any part of this plan, the <Board> may add, remove, and replace committee members, and dissolve the committee as a whole, as the law allows. 
        If the <Board> has a <Board> committee administer this plan under <Rule 16b-3> (Transactions between an issuer and its officers or directors) or section 162(m) of the <Tax Code> (Certain excessive employee remuneration), the <Board> must follow those laws in making changes to the committee, too.

        \ What the Administrator Does \
        Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes}:

            \\
            The <Administrator> determines the <Fair Market Value> for all participants in this plan under {Determining Fair Market Value}.

            \\
            The <Administrator> decides which <Company> <Employees> and <Consultants> receive <Awards>.

            \\
            The <Administrator> determines the number of shares under each <Award>.

            \\
            The <Administrator> approves form agreements for <Awards> and other documents under the plan.

            \\
            The <Administrator> determines the terms of <Awards>, within the guidelines of this plan.

            \\
            The <Administrator> may amend agreements about <Optioned Stock> and <Restricted Stock>.

            \\
            The <Administrator> may decide to buy out options under {Option Buyout}.

            \\
            The <Administrator> may set up and run an <Option Exchange Program> without additional <Company> stockholder approval.

            \\
            The <Administrator> may add and change country-specific terms to this plan under {Terms for Foreign Participants}.

            \\
            The <Administrator> may decide what the terms of this plan, documents under this plan, and agreements and other documents for <Awards>, mean. 
            The <Administrator>'s decisions on meaning apply to all <Participants>.

        \ Determining Fair Market Value \
        The <Administrator> will determine <Fair Market Value> as it thinks best. 
        When possible, the <Administrator> will determine <Fair Market Value> based on the marketing closing price of the stock reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
        The <Administrator>'s determination of <Fair Market Value> will apply, consistently, to all <Participants>.

        \ Indemnification \
        If anyone involved in administering this plan, as a member of the <Board>, a <Board> committee, or a <Company> officer, becomes involved in legal action related to this plan or an <Award> under it, the <Company> shall pay all the losses, costs, liability, judgments, and reasonable expenses they incur as a result. 
        However, the <Company> shall not pay any settlement amounts it did not approve in advance, nor any amounts at all for anyone as a result of legal action in which a court finds they failed to act in good faith. 
        To receive payment, those covered must give the <Company> a chance to take over defending the legal action, at <Company> expense, before they start defending it themselves. 
        This indemnification right does not replace or limit any other rights to indemnification those covered may have.

    \ When Participants Must Agree to Changes \
    The <Administrator> may not make changes to <Awards> and related agreements with significant negative effects on <Participants>, unless they agree.

    \ Who Can Get Which Kinds of Awards? \
    The <Administrator> may give <Nonstatutory Stock Options> and <Restricted Stock> to <Consultants>, <Employees> of the <Company>, and <Employees> of <Company Affiliates>. 
    The <Administrator> may only give <Incentive Stock Options> to <Employees> of the <Company>.

    \ Options \

        \ Kinds of Options \
        Each <Option> under this plan will be either an <Incentive Stock Option> or a <Nonstatutory Stock Option>.

        \ $100,000 Limit \
        Section 422(d) of the <Tax Code> imposes a limit, the ""$100,000 Limit"", on the number of a <Participant>'s <Options> that can be treated as <Incentive Stock Options> in a calendar year. 
        <Incentive Stock Options> that exceed that limit will be treated as <Nonstatutory Stock Options>.

        \ Option Terms \
        An <Option Agreement> will set the term of each <Option> under this plan, with two limits:

            \ 10-Year Limit \
            The longest term for any <Option> is ten years from the day granted.

            \ 5-Year Limit for Ten Percent Holders \
            The longest term for <Option> granted someone who is a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is five years from the day granted.

        If the term in an <Option Agreement> goes over its limit, the term of the <Option> is the limit, not what the <Option Agreement> says.

        \ Exercise Prices \

            \ Incentive Stock Option Exercise Prices \
            Subject to {Special Exercise Prices}, an <Option Agreement> will set the exercise price of each <Incentive Stock Option> under this plan, with three limits:

                # IRC 422(b)(4)
                \ 100% Fair Market Value Minimum \
                To satisfy section 422(b)(4) of the <Tax Code>, the lowest exercise price for an <Incentive Stock Option> granted an <Employee> who is not a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is 100% of <Fair Market Value> on grant.

                # IRC 422(c)(5)
                \ 110% Fair Market Value Minimum for Ten Percent Holders \
                To follow section 422(c)(5) of the <Tax Code>, the lowest exercise price for an <Incentive Stock Option> granted an <Employee> who is a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is 110% of <Fair Market Value> on grant.

            If the exercise price in an <Option Agreement> goes over its limit, the exercise price of the <Option> is the limit, not what the <Option Agreement> says.

            \ Nonstatutory Stock Option Exercise Prices \
            Subject to {Adjustments} and {Special Exercise Prices}, the <Administrator> will decide the exercise price of each <Nonstatutory Stock Option>. 
            If the exercise price of a <Nonstatutory Stock Option> is less than <Fair Market Value> on grant, the terms of the <Option> will abide by other laws, including section 409A of the <Tax Code> (Inclusion in gross income of deferred compensation...).

            \ Special Exercise Prices \
            The <Administrator> can set lower exercise prices pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.

        \ Payment to Exercise Options \
        The <Administrator> decides how <Participants> must pay to exercise <Options> under this plan. 
        For <Incentive Stock Options> the <Administrator> decides when granted. 
        The <Administrator> may allow payment:
            \\ in cash
            \\ by check
            \\ if the law allows, by promissory note with terms the <Administrator> decides
            \\ by canceling debt
            \\ by surrendering shares, for <Fair Market Value> at the time
            \\ <Cashless Exercise>
            \\ in any other legal way
            \\ by any combination
        The <Administrator> shall consider the benefit to the <Company> of different kinds of payment. 
        The <Administrator> may refuse to accept any kind of payment at time of exercise.

        \ Exercise \

            \ Who Can Exercise \
            Subject to {Transfer Limits on Awards}, only the holder of an <Option> can exercise it.

            \ Exercise Terms \
            The <Administrator> shall decide how <Options> can be exercised, within the limits set by this plan, and state them in <Option Agreements>.

            \ Leaves of Absence \
            The <Administrator> may decide that vesting of an <Option> should pause during a leave of absence. 
            If the <Administrator> does not decide to pause vesting, vesting continues during paid leave to the fullest legal extent.

            \ Military Leave \
            Vesting of an <Option> pauses during unpaid military leave. 
            But when a <Participant> returns from military leave with rights under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, they receive the same vesting credit under <Options> they would have received if they had continued providing service during military leave as they had before military leave.

            \ Minimum Exercise \
            <Options> cannot be exercised for fractions of a share. 
            In addition, the <Administrator> may require an <Optionee> exercise for a minimum number of shares under an <Option>, so long as the minimum does not stop the <Optionee> exercising for all the shares they can.

            \ Exercise Process \
            An <Option> is exercised once both of the following happen:

                \\ The <Company> receives written notice of exercise that meets the requirements of the <Option Agreement>.

                \\ The <Company> receives full payment for the exercise.

                \\ The <Company> has paid, or arranged to pay, any tax, withholding, deductions, and other tax payments under {Tax}.

            Exercise reduces the number of shares under the <Option> and in the <Pool>.

            \ Stockholder Rights \
            An <Optionee> exercising an <Option> does not have the right to vote, the right to received dividends, or any other rights as owner of the stock they purchase until the <Company> issues the shares and records their ownership in its corporate books or with its transfer agent. 
            Subject to {Adjustments}, the <Company> will not adjust dividend or other rights based on record dates before <Optionee> stock is issued and recorded.

            \ Leaving the Company \
            The <Administrator> decides whether and how long an <Optionee> can exercise each <Option> after their <Service with the Company> ends, and reflect that decision in the <Option Agreement>. 
            The <Administrator> may waive or change their decision at any time. 
            By default, these terms apply:

                \ Deadline to Exercise \
                If an <Option> is not exercised before its deadline, the <Option> immediately terminates, and all stock under the <Option> returns to the <Pool> under {Returning Shares to the Pool}.

                \ Disability \
                Per section 422(c)(6) of the <Tax Code>, if an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> ends because of their <Disability>, the deadline to exercise an <Option> is the first anniversary of their last day of <Service to the Company>.

                \ Death \
                Per section 422(b)(5) of the <Tax Code>, if an <Optionee> dies, either during their <Service to the Company> or within three months of their last day of <Service to the Company>, the deadline to exercise their <Option> is the first anniversary of their last day of <Service to the Company>.

                \ Termination for Cause \
                If the <Company> ends an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> for <Cause>, all their <Options> terminate immediately as soon as they learn their <Service to the Company> has ended. 
                If the <Company> suspends an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> to investigate whether to end their <Service to the Company> for <Cause>, all rights under all their <Options> suspend until the investigation ends.
                # TODO Review
                These rules do not limit any <Company> right to purchase unvested shares under any <Option Agreement>.

                # TODO Change the default?
                \ Leaving the Company Generally \
                Otherwise, the deadline to exercise an <Option> is three months from the <Optionee>'s last day of <Service to the Company>.

            \ Option Buyout \
            The <Administrator> may offer to buy out <Options> for cash or shares of common stock. 
            The <Administrator> will decide and give its terms for a buyout to the <Optionee> when it makes its offer.

    \ Restricted Stock \

        \ Grant Process \
        The <Company> will give those awarded <Restricted Stock> the terms of their offers in writing. 
        The terms will include at least:
            \\ the number of shares they can buy
            \\ the price, if any
            \\ the deadline for deciding whether to buy
        The <Administrator> decides the price, and may also grant <Restricted Stock> free of charge within the law. 
        A <Participant> accepts an offer to buy <Restricted Stock> by entering a form <Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement> approved by the <Administrator>.

        \ Payment for Restricted Stock \
        The <Administrator> decides how <Participants> must pay for <Restricted Stock>. 
        The <Administrator> may allow payment:
            \\ in cash
            \\ by check
            \\ if the law allows, by promissory note with terms the <Administrator> decides
            \\ by canceling debt
            \\ by surrendering shares the <Participant> already owns, for their <Fair Market Value> at the time
            \\ <Cashless Exercise>
            \\ in any other legal way
            \\ by any combination

        \ Buyback \

            \ Default Buyback Right\
            Unless the <Administrator> decides differently, every <Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement> will give the <Company> the right to buy back <Restricted Stock> at the same price the purchaser originally paid, whenever the buyer's <Service to the Company> ends for any reason. 
            The <Company> can pay for buybacks by canceling purchase debt to the <Company>.
            The <Administrator> will decide how the <Company>'s buyback right lapses.

            \ Buyback and Leave \
            By default, lapsing of any <Company> buyback right pauses during unpaid leave and continues during paid leave. 
            The <Administrator> may decide to pause or continue lapsing of any <Company> buyback right in a different way at any time, as the law allows. 
            Lapsing of any <Company> buyback right pauses during unpaid military leave. 
            But when a <Participant> returns from military leave with rights under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, they receive the same lapsing credit for <Restricted Stock> they would have received if they had continued providing service during military leave as they had before military leave.

        \ Other Terms \
        The <Administrator> may add any other terms, within the limits of this plan, to any <Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement>. 
        The <Administrator> may offer different <Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement> terms to different <Participants>.

        \ Stockholder Rights \
        A <Participant> purchasing <Restricted Stock> does not have the right to vote, the right to received dividends, or any other rights as owner of the stock they purchase until the <Company> issues the shares and records their ownership in its corporate books or with its transfer agent. 
        Subject to {Adjustments}, the <Company> will not adjust dividend or other rights based on record dates before <Restricted Stock> is issued and recorded.

    \ Tax \

        \ Making Arrangements for Tax \
        Receiving an <Award>, exercising an <Award>, accumulate vesting, and lapsing a buyback right are all conditioned on the <Participant> making any arrangements the <Administrator> requires for covering tax obligations under foreign, federal, state, and local tax law. 
        The <Company> will not issue stock until tax obligations are covered.

        \ Cashless Exercise \
        As the law allows, the <Administrator> allow a <Participant> to cover all or part of their tax obligations by <Cashless Exercise> and surrendering shares the <Participant> already owns. 
        Unless the <Company> gives specific permission, every <Cashless Exercise> must either be broker-assisted or limited to avoid financial accounting charges, and the <Participant> must have held shares surrendered for a <Cashless Exercise> for enough time to avoid financial accounting charges. 
        Laws and regulations may impose other restrictions on paying tax by surrendering shares.

    \ Adjustments \

        \ Proportional Adjustment \
        Subject to any stockholder approval required by law, all <Stock-Related Attributes> under this plan are automatically adjusted, proportionally, whenever the <Company> makes a <Stock Change>.

        \\ ""Stock-Related Attributes"" means all of:

            \\ number and kind of securities in the <Pool>

            \\ number and kind of securities under any <Award>

            \\ exercise price per share under any <Option>

            \\ price per share under any <Company> buyback right under any <Award>

        \\ ""Stock Change"" means all of:

            \\ stock split

            \\ reverse stock split

            \\ stock dividend

            \\ combination

            \\ consolidation

            \\ reclassification of shares

            \\ subdivision of shares

        \\
        The <Administrator> may adjust any <Stock-Related Attributes> as it thinks appropriate whenever the <Company> does a <Reorganization>. 
        The <Administrator>'s changes are final.


        \\ ""Reorganization"" means all of:

            \\ the number of issued shares changes without the <Company> receiving any legal "consideration"

            \\ the <Company> declares an extraordinary dividend for shares paid other than in shares with a significant effect on <Fair Market Value>

            \\ recapitalization, including through a large nonrecurring cash dividend

            \\ rights offering

            \\ reorganization

            \\ merger

            \\ spin-off

            \\ split-up

            \\ change in corporate structure

            \\ similar occurrence

        \\
        Otherwise, the fact that the <Company> issues stock or securities convertible to stock will not affects or prompt any adjustment to any <Stock-Related Attributes> under any <Award>.

        \\
        Whenever a <Stock Change> or <Reorganization> leads to an adjustment of a <Participant>'s <Award> or <Award Agreement> so that it covers more or different securities, those securities are subject to the same terms.

        \ Dissolution and Liquidation \
        Unless the <Administrator> decides differently, every <Awards> terminates immediately before any dissolution or liquidation of the <Company>.

        \ Corporate Transactions \
        The <Administrator> decides how to treat each <Award> whenever the <Company> does a <Corporate Transaction>, without any consent from any <Participant>. 
        The <Administrator> may treat <Awards> differently.
        For example, the <Administrator> may choose 
        The <Administrator> will decide that:

            \\
            the <Company>, if it survives the <Corporate Transaction>, will continue an outstanding <Award>

            \\
            a different corporation that survives the <Corporate Transaction>, or its parent company, will continue an outstanding <Award>

            \\
            a different corporation that survives the <Corporate Transaction>, or its parent company, will substitute a new option or equity award for an <Award>

            \\
            the <Company> will cancel the <Award> in exchange for payment of the amount by which the <Fair Market Value> of the shares under the <Award> on the closing date of the <Corporate Transaction> exceed the exercise price or purchase price under the <Award>

            \\
            the <Company> will cancel the <Award> for nothing

        \\ ""Corporate Transaction"" means any of:

            \\
            transfer of all or substantially all the <Company>'s assets

            \\
            merger, consolidation, other capital reorganization, or other business combination transaction of the <Company> with or into another corporation, entity, or person

            \\
            the consummation of a transaction, or series of related transactions, in which any "person" (as used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the <Exchange Act>) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the <Exchange Act>), directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the <Company>'s then outstanding capital stock

    \ Transfer Limits \

        \ Transfer Limits on Awards \

            \ No Transferring Awards \
            Other than under {Transfer by Will and Inheritance}, {While the Company Relies on 12h-1(f)} and {Transfers to Trusts}, no one may <Transfer an Award>.

            \\ ""Transfer an Award"" means, of an <Award> or any right under any <Award>, selling, pledging, assigning, or using to secure a debt, taking a short position, taking a "put equivalent position" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) of the <Exchange Act>), or taking a "call equivalent position" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(b) of the <Exchange Act>). 
            Naming a beneficiary does not <Transfer an Award>.

            \ Transfer by Will and Inheritance \
            A <Participant> may <Transfer an Award> by will or under inheritance law.

            \ While the Company Relies on 12h-1(f) \
            With four exceptions, no one may <Transfer an Award> that is an <Option>, or any stock under any <Option>, while the <Company> is relying on the securities law exemption under Rule 12h-1(f)(1) of the <Exchange Act>. 
            The <Board> alone decides when the <Company> is relying on that exemption. 
            The exceptions are:
                \\ transfer to <Family Members> by gift or under domestic relations orders
                \\ transfer to a <Participant>'s executor on death
                \\ transfer to a <Participant>'s guardian on disability
                \\ <Board>-approved transfer of <Nonstatutory Stock Options> to the <Company> in connection with an acquisition transaction per Rule 12h-1(f)

            \ Rule 12h-1(f) Disclosures \
            The <Company> will provide all <Optionees> the information required by Rule 701(e)(3), (4), and (5) of the <Securities Act> whenever the <Company> relies on the securities law exemption under Rule 12h-1(f)(1), to comply with the requirements of the exemption. 
            The <Company> may request that <Optionees> keep that information confidential. 
            If an <Optionee> refuses to keep the information confidential, the <Company> will provide no more information than required by Rule 12h-1(f)(1).

            \ Transfers to Trusts \
            The <Administrator> may allow a <Participant> to transfer a <Nonstatutory Stock Option> to a living trust or will trust, so long as the trust will gift the <Nonstatutory Stock Option> to <Family Members> or pass it to beneficiaries when the maker of the trust dies.

        \ Transfer Limits on Stock \

            \ No Transferring Stock \
            <Stock Transfer> is not allowed, unless the <Company>'s specific permission, in writing and in advance.
            The <Company> may refuse permission for a <Stock Transfer> for any reason. 

            \\
            ""Stock Transfer"" means any transfer, read broadly, of any interest in stock acquired under an <Award>.
            Selling, gifting, placing in trust, pledging for a debt, or allowing a lien to apply to stock are each an example of a <Stock Transfer>.
            So are transactions, like short sales, offsetting derivatives, futures, forward contracts, that significantly change the financial risk and benefits of owning stock. 
            Giving another the right to vote or take other action as a stockholder, perhaps by proxy, is also a <Stock Transfer>. 
            An agreement to do a <Stock Transfer> is itself a <Stock Transfer>.

            \ Attempted Transfers \
            Any attempted <Transfer> in violation of this plan has no legal effect. 
            The <Company> will neither transfer shares under such a transfer on its books, nor treat the attempted recipient the as if they had rights as a shareholder.

            \ Approval Process \
            A <Participant> may request permission to <Transfer> shares by writing the secretary of the <Company> with all of the following information: 
                \\ their name
                \\ the name of the proposed recipient of the shares
                \\ the number of shares
                \\ the purchase price
            The <Company> may require additional information of the <Participant>. 
            The <Participant>'s request will also fall under any right of first refusal, transfer provision, or other term of their <Award Agreement>.

    \ Award Dates \
    The <Administrator> decides what date counts as the date of an <Award>. 
    By default, the date of an <Award> is the date the <Administrator> determined to grant the <Award>.

    \ No Employment Rights \
    Neither this plan nor any <Award> under it give anyone any right to continued employment or contract work.

    \ Term of the Plan \
    This plan starts when the <Board> adopts it and ends 10 years later. 
    Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes}, the <Board> may terminate this plan earlier.

    \ Changes to the Plan \
    Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes} and any legal requirements, the <Board> may change this plan over time.

    \ Issuing Shares \
    Despite any term of this plan or any <Award Agreement>, the <Company> will not issue any stock under this plan unless the <Company>, with its lawyers, decides that doing so would be legal. 
    The <Company> will not be liable to anyone for delaying or refusing to issue shares in a way it believes would break the law. 
    If the <Company>'s lawyers request, the <Company> may requires a <Participant> to make representations and warranties at the time they exercise an <Option> or buy <Restricted Stock> to comply with the law and requirements for securities laws exemptions. 
    # TODO Necessary to restate
    Stock received by exercising an <Option> or buying <Restricted Stock>, before the <Company>'s commons stock becomes a <Listed Security>, is subject to <Company> rights of first refusal per the <Award Agreement>.

    \ Beneficiaries \
    With the <Company>'s prior written permission, a <Participant> may designate beneficiaries for an <Award> by filing a <Company>-approved form. 
    Once a <Participant> has designated a beneficiary, the <Participant> may change their designation by filing a <Company>-approved form. 
    Unless an <Award Agreement> says otherwise, if a deceased <Participant> does not designate a beneficiary for the <Award> who survives them, the <Award> goes to those entitled under the <Participant>'s will or under the inheritance law.

    \ Stockholder Approval \
    The law may require this plan be approved by <Company> stockholders within twelve months of adoption, as well as any change under {Changes to the Plan}.

    \ Terms for Foreign Participants \
    The <Administrator> may approve additions to this plan with terms to accommodate legal, tax, policy, and custom differences for <Awards> subject to foreign law. 
    The terms of additions trump the terms of this plan as needed to accommodate those differences. 
    They will not have any other effect on this plan or other <Awards>.
