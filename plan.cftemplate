This is a plan for ""Company"", [Company Name], to give ""Awards"" of <Company> stock and options to buy <Company> stock.

    \ Purposes \ This plan has three main purposes:

        \\
        This plan makes it possible to give <Awards> without breaking securities laws. 
        In general, securities laws require companies to register their stock before giving it out. 
        Registering takes a lot of time and money. 
        Fortunately, exceptions allow companies to give out their stock without doing the whole registration process. 
        This plan is designed to follow the exception under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933. 
        Rule 701 covers awards to employees and others who help the <Company> under written stock plans that follow specific rules.

        \\
        This plan helps some <Awards> qualify for good tax treatment. 
        For example, some <Awards> of stock can qualify for the special tax elections under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
        Some <Awards> of options can qualify for special treatment as "Incentive Stock Options" under sections 422 and 421 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
        This plan cannot guarantee good tax treatment or tell people who get <Awards> how to keep their tax low. 
        But it can help <Awards> qualify for special treatment that people who get <Awards> might want.

        \\
        This plan helps organize the process of giving <Awards> over time. 
        It sets up a process for giving <Awards>, and rules for adjusting them if the <Company> reorganizes itself. 
        It also comes with standard forms for several kinds of <Awards>.
