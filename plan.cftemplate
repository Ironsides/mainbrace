This is a plan for ""Company"", [Company Name], to give ""Awards"" of <Company> stock and options to buy <Company> stock.

    \ Purposes \ This plan has three main purposes:

        \\
        This plan makes it possible to give <Awards> without breaking securities laws. 
        In general, securities laws require companies to register their stock before giving it out. 
        Registering takes a lot of time and money. 
        Fortunately, exceptions allow companies to give out their stock without doing the whole registration process. 
        This plan is designed to follow the exception under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933. 
        Rule 701 covers awards to employees and others who help the <Company> under written stock plans that follow specific rules.

        \\
        This plan helps some <Awards> qualify for good tax treatment. 
        For example, some <Awards> of stock can qualify for the special tax elections under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
        Some <Awards> of options can qualify for special treatment as ""Incentive Stock Options"" under section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, the ""Tax Code Section on ISOs"". 
        This plan cannot guarantee good tax treatment or tell people who get <Awards> how to keep their tax low. 
        But it can help <Awards> qualify for special treatment that people who get <Awards> might want.

        \\
        This plan helps organize the process of giving <Awards> over time. 
        It sets up a process for giving <Awards>, and rules for adjusting them if the <Company> reorganizes itself. 
        It also comes with standard forms for several kinds of <Awards>.

    \ Contents \
    This plan sets out rules for its administration and for <Awards> generally. 
    It also gives some words and phrases specific definitions that apply throughout this plan and <Awards> documents.

    \ Stock Pool \

        \ Shares in the Pool \
        Under this plan, the <Administrator> may issue up to [Pool Shares] shares of the <Company>'s common stock under <Awards>. 
        This number is called the ""Pool"", and its starting size is called the ""Starting Size of the Pool"". 
        The <Administrator> may issue the whole <Pool> under <Incentive Stock Options> if it chooses.

        # Consider "recycle"
        \ Returning Shares to the Pool \
        Some stock under <Awards> can return to the <Pool>, to be recycled under new <Awards>.

            \\ When an <Award> expires before all the <Company> issues all the stock under it, the stock the <Company> has not issued returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When an <Award> can no longer be exercised, any stock under the <Award> that the <Company> has not issued returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When an <Option> is traded in under an <Option Exchange Program>, the stock under the <Option> returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When the <Company> holds back shares under an <Award> to cover part of the <Recipient>'s purchase price or withholding tax, the stock the <Company> holds back returns to the <Pool>.

            \\ When <Restricted Shares> are forfeited to the <Company>, those shares return to the <Pool>.

            \\ When the <Company> uses a <Repurchase Right> to buy back <Restricted Shares>, those shares return to the <Pool>.

        Stock stops returning to the <Pool> when this plan terminates.

        \ Adjusting the Size of the Pool \
        The number of shares in the <Pool> can be adjusted under {When the Company's Structure Changes}. 
        However, the <Administrator> cannot issue more than the <Starting Size of the Pool> under <Incentive Stock Options> unless the <Section of the Tax Code on ISOs> allows the <Administrator> to recycle more shares.

    \ Administration \

        \ Who Administers this Plan? \
        The board of directors of the <Company>, the ""Board"", decides who administers this plan. 
        The <Board> may decide that:

            \\
            The <Board> administers this plan.

            \\
            A <Board> committee administers this plan.

            \\
            The <Board> and a <Board> committee administer this plan.

        A <Company> officer or group of <Company> officers may make <Awards> within limits set by the <Board>, if the law allows. 
        But the <Board> may not allow <Company> officers to make <Awards> to those covered by section 16 of the <Exchange Act> (Directors, Officers, and Principal Stockholders).

        \ Changing Who Administers the Plan \
        The <Board> may change who administers this plan over time. 
        If the <Board> uses a <Board> committee to administer any part of this plan, the <Board> may add, remove, and replace committee members, and dissolve the committee as a whole, as the law allows. 
        If the <Board> has a <Board> committee administer this plan under <Rule 16b-3> (Transactions between an issuer and its officers or directors) or section 162(m) of the <Tax Code> (Certain excessive employee remuneration), the <Board> must follow those laws in making changes to the committee, too.

        \ What the Administrator Does \
        Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes}:

            \\

            \\
            The <Administrator> may decide what the terms of this plan, documents under this plan, and agreements and other documents for <Awards>, mean. 
            The <Administrator>'s decisions on meaning apply to all <Participants>.

        \ Indemnification \
        If anyone involved in administering this plan, as a member of the <Board>, a <Board> committee, or a <Company> officer, becomes involved in legal action related to this plan or an <Award> under it, the <Company> shall pay all the losses, costs, liability, judgments, and reasonable expenses they incur as a result. 
        However, the <Company> shall not pay any settlement amounts it did not approve in advance, nor any amounts at all for anyone as a result of legal action in which a court finds they failed to act in good faith. 
        To receive payment, those covered must give the <Company> a chance to take over defending the legal action, at <Company> expense, before they start defending it themselves. 
        This indemnification right does not replace or limit any other rights to indemnification those covered may have.

    \ When Participants Must Agree to Changes \
    The <Administrator> may not make changes to <Awards> and related agreements with significant negative effects on <Participants>, unless they agree.

    \ Who Can Get Which Kinds of Awards? \
    The <Administrator> may give <Nonstatutory Stock Options> and <Restricted Stock> to <Consultants>, <Employees> of the <Company>, and <Employees> of <Company Affiliates>. 
    The <Administrator> may only give <Incentive Stock Options> to <Employees> of the <Company>.

    \ Options \

        \ Kinds of Options \
        Each <Option> under this plan will be either an <Incentive Stock Option> or a <Nonstatutory Stock Option>.

        \ $100,000 Limit \
        Section 422(d) of the <Tax Code> imposes a limit, the ""$100,000 Limit"", on the number of a <Participant>'s <Options> that can be treated as <Incentive Stock Options> in a calendar year. 
        <Incentive Stock Options> that exceed that limit will be treated as <Nonstatutory Stock Options>.

        \ Option Terms \
        An <Option Agreement> will set the term of each <Option> under this plan, with two limits:

            \ 10-Year Limit \
            The longest term for any <Option> is ten years from the day granted.

            \ 5-Year Limit for Ten Percent Holders \
            The longest term for <Option> granted someone who is a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is five years from the day granted.

        If the term in an <Option Agreement> goes over its limit, the term of the <Option> is the limit, not what the <Option Agreement> says.

        \ Exercise Prices \

            \ Incentive Stock Option Exercise Prices \
            Subject to {Special Exercise Prices}, an <Option Agreement> will set the exercise price of each <Incentive Stock Option> under this plan, with three limits:

                # IRC 422(b)(4)
                \ 100% Fair Market Value Minimum \
                To satisfy section 422(b)(4) of the <Tax Code>, the lowest exercise price for an <Incentive Stock Option> granted an <Employee> who is not a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is 100% of <Fair Market Value> on grant.

                # IRC 422(c)(5)
                \ 110% Fair Market Value Minimum for Ten Percent Holders \
                To follow section 422(c)(5) of the <Tax Code>, the lowest exercise price for an <Incentive Stock Option> granted an <Employee> who is a <Ten Percent Holder> at the time is 110% of <Fair Market Value> on grant.

            If the exercise price in an <Option Agreement> goes over its limit, the exercise price of the <Option> is the limit, not what the <Option Agreement> says.

            \ Nonstatutory Stock Option Exercise Prices \
            Subject to {Adjustments} and {Special Exercise Prices}, the <Administrator> will decide the exercise price of each <Nonstatutory Stock Option>. 
            If the exercise price of a <Nonstatutory Stock Option> is less than <Fair Market Value> on grant, the terms of the <Option> will abide by other laws, including section 409A of the <Tax Code> (Inclusion in gross income of deferred compensation...).

            \ Special Exercise Prices \
            The <Administrator> can set lower exercise prices pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.

        \ Option Payments \
        The <Administrator> determines how <Participants> must pay to exercise <Options> under this plan. 
        For <Incentive Stock Options> the <Administrator> decides when granted. 
        The <Administrator> may allow payment:
            \\ in cash; or
            \\ by check; or
            \\ if the law allows, by promissory note with terms the <Administrator> decides; or
            \\ by canceling debt; or
            \\ by surrendering shares, for <Fair Market Value> at the time; or
            \\ <Cashless Exercise>; or
            \\ in any other legal way; or
            \\ any combination
        The <Administrator> shall consider the benefit to the <Company> of different kinds of payment. 
        The <Administrator> may refuse to accept any kind of payment at time of exercise.

        \ Exercise \

            \ Exercise Terms \
            The <Administrator> shall decide how <Options> can be exercised, within the limits set by this plan, and state them in <Option Agreements>.

            \ Leaves of Absence \
            The <Administrator> may decide that vesting of an <Option> should pause during a leave of absence. 
            If the <Administrator> does not decide to pause vesting, vesting continues during paid leave to the fullest legal extent.

            \ Military Leave \
            Vesting of an <Option> pauses during unpaid military leave. 
            But when a <Participant> returns from military leave with rights under the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, they receive the same vesting credit under <Options> they would have received if they had continued providing service during military leave as they had before military leave.

            \ Minimum Exercise \
            <Options> cannot be exercised for fractions of a share. 
            In addition, the <Administrator> may require an <Optionee> exercise for a minimum number of shares under an <Option>, so long as the minimum does not stop the <Optionee> exercising for all the shares they can.

            \ Exercise Process \
            An <Option> is exercised once both of the following happen:

                \\ The <Company> receives written notice of exercise that meets the requirements of the <Option Agreement>.

                \\ The <Company> receives full payment for the exercise.

                \\ The <Company> has paid, or arranged to pay, any tax, withholding, deductions, and other tax payments under {Tax}.

            Exercise reduces the number of shares under the <Option> and in the <Pool>.

            \ Stockholder Rights \
            An <Optionee> exercising an <Option> does not have the right to vote, the right to received dividends, or any other rights as owner of the stock they purchase until the <Company> issues the shares and records their ownership in its corporate books or with its transfer agent. 
            Subject to {Adjustments}, the <Company> will not adjust dividend or other rights based on record dates before <Optionee> stock is issued and recorded.

            \ Leaving the Company \
            The <Administrator> decides whether and how long an <Optionee> can exercise each <Option> after their <Service with the Company> ends, and reflect that decision in the <Option Agreement>. 
            The <Administrator> may waive or change their decision at any time. 
            By default, these terms apply:

                \ Deadline to Exercise \
                If an <Option> is not exercised before its deadline, the <Option> immediately terminates, and all stock under the <Option> returns to the <Pool> under {Returning Shares to the Pool}.

                \ Disability \
                Per section 422(c)(6) of the <Tax Code>, if an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> ends because of their <Disability>, the deadline to exercise an <Option> is the first anniversary of their last day of <Service to the Company>.

                \ Death \
                Per section 422(b)(5) of the <Tax Code>, if an <Optionee> dies, either during their <Service to the Company> or within three months of their last day of <Service to the Company>, the deadline to exercise their <Option> is the first anniversary of their last day of <Service to the Company>.

                \ Termination for Cause \
                If the <Company> ends an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> for <Cause>, all their <Options> terminate immediately as soon as they learn their <Service to the Company> has ended. 
                If the <Company> suspends an <Optionee>'s <Service to the Company> to investigate whether to end their <Service to the Company> for <Cause>, all rights under all their <Options> suspend until the investigation ends.
                # TODO Review
                These rules do not limit any <Company> right to purchase unvested shares under any <Option Agreement>.

                # TODO Change the default?
                \ Leaving the Company Generally \
                Otherwise, the deadline to exercise an <Option> is three months from the <Optionee>'s last day of <Service to the Company>.

            \ Option Buyout \
            The <Administrator> may offer to buy out <Options> for cash or shares of common stock. 
            The <Administrator> will decide and give its terms for a buyout to the <Optionee> when it makes its offer.

    \ No Employment Rights \
    Neither this plan nor any <Award> under it give anyone any right to continued employment or contract work.

    \ Term of the Plan \
    This plan starts when the <Board> adopts it and ends 10 years later. 
    Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes}, the <Board> may terminate this plan earlier.

    \ Changes to the Plan \
    Subject to {When Participants Must Agree to Changes} and any legal requirements, the <Board> may change this plan over time.
